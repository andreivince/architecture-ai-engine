The structure presents as a rectilinear, box-like massing of two floors, articulated by a continuous and regular vertical and horizontal grid system across all primary elevations, with approximately five vertical bays and two horizontal subdivisions per visible elevation, establishing a strict modular rhythm. The ground floor is volumetrically set apart by an unbroken base with no vertical subdivision, creating a sharp contrast with the articulated upper grid, and is slightly recessed to heighten separation from the upper portion. The volumetric hierarchy is simple: both floors read as stacked parallelepipeds with no significant cantilever or setback; however, a modest projecting volumetric module appears at one upper corner, further differentiating the gridâ€™s rhythm. No large rectilinear voids or penetrative cutouts interrupt the primary massing, the negative space is mainly expressed through the regular spacing of narrow vertical voids (grid bays) rather than larger, frame-like recesses or through-volume interruptions. The spatial logic emphasizes clarity, modularity, and the dominance of a collective grid, with the horizontal datum of the ground floor accentuated via uninterrupted volumetric continuity.
