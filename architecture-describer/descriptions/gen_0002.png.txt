The structure presents as a four-story rectilinear mass defined by a rigid grid subdivision on all elevations, organizing the form into a dominant vertical module that establishes a consistent rhythm across each fa√ßade. Volumetric hierarchy is expressed through volumetric stacking, where horizontal projecting elements protrude at regular intervals on the upper three floors, creating a system of frame-like modules that establish a layered order and accentuate horizontal stratification. Significant rectilinear voids interrupt the primary massing, with deep cut-outs vertically penetrating across two to three floors on opposing elevations, resulting in powerful negative spaces that structure the volumetric logic and introduce an interplay of solid and void. The ground floor is distinctly set apart by a continuous, unbroken base with no vertical subdivision, contrasting sharply with the highly gridded upper volumes, and is recessed behind the primary plane, amplifying the sense of a floating or cantilevered upper mass with clear spatial separation from the ground plane.
