A rigorously asymmetrical high-rise composed of 11 floors, this structure is defined by a staggered stack of rectilinear glass volumes, with each floor shifting laterally to produce a stepped, sculptural silhouette—no two floors align precisely in plan view. The building’s massing broadens notably at the podium, then tapers and becomes vertically linear by the top three floors, enforcing a pronounced spatial hierarchy from grounded base to narrow crown. The ground floor is distinctly articulated by its complete transparency: smooth, uninterrupted floor-to-ceiling glazing with no visible mullions or structural breaks, maximizing open visibility and sharply contrasting the more subdivided upper floors. Above, each floor comprises a series of horizontal boxes projecting variably outward, with clear glass curtain walls framed by thin brushed aluminum mullions (~6 cm thick), forming an irregular grid subdivided into 2 or 3 bays per façade segment, with joints misaligned between levels for a dynamic modulation. Upper terraces and overhangs average 2 meters deep, with balconies set behind glass balustrades. The top floor reasserts dominance via a strong cantilever to one side—visibly rotated and offset from the stack below, creating sculptural asymmetry at the crown. Volume sequence, glazing style, and lateral displacement are all manipulated to privilege bottom-to-top legibility: absolute transparency at street interface, articulated grid above, and an iconic, off-axis terminal floor.
