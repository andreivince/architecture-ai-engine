A rectilinear modern tower with 10 full floors, the building is composed of a single, vertically extruded rectangular volume with perfectly symmetrical massing on all sides. The ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately twice the height of upper floors—and stands out through complete transparency: the glass is smooth and uninterrupted, with no visible mullions or structural breaks, maximizing open visibility and a seamless transition between interior and exterior. Upper floors are identically stacked and do not rotate or shift; each level has continuous wraparound balconies projecting precisely 2 meters from the facade edges, creating a pronounced horizontal rhythm. The upper facades are organized by a strict structural grid: each face has 4 vertical bays per floor, articulated by slim, evenly spaced dark mullions approximately 5 cm thick, with balcony panels of translucent green glass and floor-to-ceiling clear glazing behind. There are no visible setbacks, overhangs, or breaks in the stacking; the building’s hierarchy is enforced through the contrast of the transparent, open ground floor and the repetitive, rigorously gridded upper levels enclosed by framed balcony volumes.
