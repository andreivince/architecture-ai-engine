The building demonstrates three principal floors with clear volumetric hierarchy, expressed through stacked cubic modules that are offset both laterally and vertically; cantilevered volumes project on the upper two levels, disrupting the overall prismatic outline and introducing horizontal articulation above the ground plane. The grid logic is explicit, with a rigorous vertical and horizontal subdivision creating a uniform, rectilinear matrix across all visible elevations, averaging eight subdivisions per facade across each story. A pronounced rectilinear void interrupts the massing across the uppermost two floors at the leftmost corner, while recessed terraces of approximately one structural bay in depth are embedded within the volumetric composition on both the second and third floors. The ground floor operates as a distinct, largely unbroken base layer, slightly recessed relative to the upper massing and exhibiting no vertical grid subdivision in the central frontage, thus contrasting sharply with the rhythmic upper grid and accentuating the hovering effect of the volumes above. Negative space is articulated through both the voids and deep setbacks at intersections of modules, reinforcing an overall interplay of solid and void and organizing the buildingâ€™s massing by a strict geometric and modular rationale.
