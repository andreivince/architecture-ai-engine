The structure presents as a rectilinear two-floor massing articulated by a strict vertical and horizontal grid, producing a regular module rhythm across all elevations with no apparent volumetric hierarchy; the separation between floors is subtle and the composition remains monolithic. The void logic is defined by the clear, volumetrically unbroken wrapping grid that establishes repeated vertical subdivisions without interruption for cut-outs or significant recesses. The ground floor operates as a distinct layer through a full-perimeter horizontal setback, creating a floating effect for the upper volume and an unbroken base with no vertical subdivision, which sharply contrasts the upper grid. No major voids or frame-like cutouts penetrate through the mass, and the structureâ€™s geometry is expressed purely through its disciplined grid, exposed setbacks, and the volumetric clarity of a single rectilinear box elevated on a consistently receded podium.
