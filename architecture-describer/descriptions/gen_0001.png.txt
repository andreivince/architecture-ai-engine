The building exhibits a rectilinear massing of five primary floors, articulated by a clear volumetric hierarchy with a dominant upper block floating above a recessed ground floor layer. The facade is organized along a strict vertical and horizontal grid subdividing each elevation into a regular array of modules, with a rhythm of closely spaced mullions establishing a repetitive structure across all visible sides. A large rectilinear void interrupts the massing at the interface between the first and second story, achieved through strategic recesses and cutouts, resulting in portions of the upper volume projecting outwards and cantilevering above the ground plan. The ground floor is volumetrically set apart, deeply recessed beneath the main structure, forming an unbroken base with no vertical subdivision that contrasts sharply with the articulated and subdivided upper grid. Negative space is emphasized through the pronounced undercroft, further enhanced by the protruding modules above, reinforcing the distinction between loadbearing plinth and elevated, stacked grid forms.
