A rectilinear modernist residential tower comprised of eight stories, the building exhibits strict verticality with pronounced volumetric stacking, and a clear spatial hierarchy defined by asymmetrical cantilevering: each upper floor’s cube is extruded to different sides, resulting in offset balconies that project ~2 meters beyond the core on alternating corners. The ground floor, approximately 1.5x the height of typical floors, is set apart by complete transparency; the glass here is smooth and uninterrupted, with no visible mullions or structural breaks, producing total visual openness and sharply contrasting the rhythm of the upper floors. Above, each floorplate features a regular modular grid—three horizontal bays per facade, each divided by slim vertical mullions (~5cm thick), and enclosed with clear glazing framed in matte silver aluminum. Balconies run along the perimeter except where the next volume above overhangs, reinforcing the asymmetric stacking logic. The top floor strictly continues this system, with no rotation or cap, emphasizing the building’s repeated extruded cube motif without deviation or crown. The massing aggressively foregrounds the offset balcony pattern, making this staggered horizontal extension the defining architectural feature.
