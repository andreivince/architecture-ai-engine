The building’s massing comprises a primary rectilinear form articulated by a five-floor volumetric hierarchy, with prominent setbacks and projecting modules defining the upper three floors. The elevations are structured by a consistent vertical grid subdivided into bays of regular width, yielding a pronounced rhythmic repetition; this grid remains unbroken vertically along the façades, except where projecting volumes create horizontal offsets. Cantilevered modules extend outward on multiple sides beginning at the second and third floors, establishing a stepped volumetric progression. Recessed voids occur at ground level, demarcating the base as a distinct horizontal layer, further emphasized by the lack of vertical grid subdivision in this stratum—a continuous base contrasts sharply with the regular upper grid. No large penetrative voids interrupt the main mass, but repeated rectilinear projections and setbacks generate significant negative space and frame-like recesses on upper levels.
