The building exhibits an articulated massing comprising approximately ten floors, organized as stacked rectilinear volumes with a pronounced hierarchical composition featuring alternating projecting and recessed elements. The primary volumetric logic employs a grid-based subdivision on each elevation, establishing a uniform rhythm of rectilinear modules both horizontally and vertically, with consistent bay dimensions interrupted by larger, frame-like voids at irregular intervals. Multiple substantial rectilinear voids penetrate the massing, particularly evident across the lower and upper thirds of the structure, creating deep cut-outs and negative spaces that define the spatial hierarchy and introduce distinct horizontal setbacks. The ground floor functions as a clear volumetric base, perceptibly recessed compared to upper floors and defined by an unbroken perimeter devoid of vertical grid subdivisons, establishing a sharp contrast with the rigorous modular logic above. Cantilevered volumes project laterally at several levels, emphasizing floating modules and further disrupting the massing with layered setbacks and terraces, while intermediate floors contain recessed terrace voids that span multiple grid bays, reinforcing the interplay between solid and void through both horizontal and vertical axes.
