A perfectly symmetrical, cubic high-rise with eight total floors, this building asserts strict rectilinear massing and absolute alignment on all sides; the volume is a pure square prism, with no projections or offset. The most dominant feature is the ground floor, which is fully glazed with entirely smooth, uninterrupted glass—there are no mullions or visible structural divisions, yielding a hyper-transparent base that creates a dramatic visual break from the upper levels. The ground floor height is approximately twice that of a typical upper floor, accentuating the “floating” effect of the building above. Above, seven identical upper floors are defined by a rigid façade grid: each elevation displays five vertical bays subdivided into three horizontal rows per floor, with all window mullions a precise 6 cm thick in dark metal. The glass on these upper floors is lightly tinted, set in slim brushed aluminum frames, maintaining absolute planar fidelity—no shifting, stepping, or rotation breaks the stacking. There are no setbacks, balconies, or visual interruptions; the upper mass is a perfect glass box poised on a crystal-clear plinth. Hierarchy is explicit: the striking transparency and seamless glazing of the ground floor radically contrast the tightly regimented grid of the upper volumes, enforcing a clear spatial and visual distinction.
