A rectilinear, cubic building with five visible floors, each floor clearly expressed by projecting horizontal massing and a strong façade grid; upper four floors have consistent vertical and horizontal modules of metal cladding panels and regularly spaced narrow vertical window strips, with each horizontal band split into approximately five bays per side and mullion thickness visibly 8–10 cm; spandrels are absent, as floor divisions are articulated solely by the horizontal shift in massing, with no exterior floor breaks or expressed structural elements. The ground floor is visually distinct and recessed, appearing approximately 1.5 times taller than upper levels, with uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base: NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, allowing clear interior visibility and creating strong volumetric separation from the gridded pattern above; warm lighting within enhances the visual permeability and marks the ground floor as fundamentally different in materiality and openness from the densely folded upper façade. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—a distinct visual transition is necessary between base and upper volumes.
