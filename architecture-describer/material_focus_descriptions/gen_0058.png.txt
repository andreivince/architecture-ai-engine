A rectilinear building with 8 visible floors, each floor except the ground is of consistent height, while the ground floor is clearly taller, approximately 1.5 times the height of a typical upper level. The façade features a strict grid of rectangular modules, with each floor divided into 4 horizontal bays and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay, forming a prominent rhythm. Mullions are visible on upper floors, approximately 8 cm thick, creating a strong orthogonal pattern, while spandrels are absent, ensuring uninterrupted vertical glass strips. The massing is articulated with projecting and recessed volumes on all floors above the base, introducing a dynamic, stacked appearance. The ground floor is volumetrically distinct, with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—and warm interior lighting clearly visible, explicitly contrasting the upper grid pattern. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; there is a distinct visual transition between the transparent, open base and the articulated, structured upper façade.
