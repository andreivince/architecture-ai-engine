A rectilinear high-rise tower with 15 visible floors, the façade features a strict vertical rhythm of glazed curtain wall modules delineated by thin vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick and horizontal divisions aligning with each floor slab; there are no spandrels—each floor is visually continuous, and the vertical subdivisions remain consistent across all upper floors, with each elevation presenting three primary vertical bays per side. The ground floor is distinctly taller than upper levels, approximately double the floor-to-floor height, and is fully enclosed by uninterrupted transparent glazing with smooth glass panels—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—creating a clear volumetric and visual distinction from the gridded upper stories; the base glows with warm lighting and high interior visibility, whereas upper floors show standard height, transparency, and materiality, maintaining consistent grid patterns throughout. The massing is clean and unbroken, with projecting glassed balcony modules further articulating the vertical grid. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—this is a distinct visual transition marked by uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, making absolute hierarchy between podium and tower façade explicit.
