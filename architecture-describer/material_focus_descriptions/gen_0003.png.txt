A rectilinear glass building with four visibly stacked floors, where the ground floor is approximately 1.75 times the height of upper levels and forms a prominent volumetric base, is rendered in modular massing with multiple cantilevered sections. The façade is defined by a strict gridded rhythm: each upper floor features a curtain wall system with vertical mullions spaced roughly 60-80 cm apart and thinner horizontal transoms of comparable thickness, creating continuous vertical and horizontal subdivisions. No visible spandrel panels interrupt the glass; the transparent glazing reveals interior divisions. The upper three floors maintain the exact grid pattern, while the ground floor stands unique—its taller double-height volume is clad in uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glass. Warm lighting and clear interior visibility emphasize this contrast, presenting a smooth, mullion-free perimeter at the base, with a distinct visual transition to the orthogonal, mullion-dominated upper grid. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
