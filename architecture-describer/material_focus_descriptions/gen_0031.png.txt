A rectilinear building with two visible floors, where the ground floor is explicitly double-height and clearly taller than the upper floor, forms the base of the massing; the façade utilizes full-height glazing with no visible spandrels or horizontal breaks, establishing two uninterrupted vertical layers. The upper floor features a grid of precisely 11 horizontal bays across the main elevation, each subdivided by prominent vertical mullions approximately 10 cm thick, producing a regular rhythm of vertical modules. The upper glazing is semi-transparent and sectioned, while the ground floor façade employs large, continuous transparent glass panels with NO vertical mullions or divisions, creating uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and yielding a distinct visual transition between the base and the upper grid pattern. Warm interior lighting and high transparency at the ground level accentuate volumetric distinction, with visible interior elements demonstrating spatial depth. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—this explicit contrast in material transparency, mullion presence, and façade rhythm is essential.
