A rectilinear building with three visible floors, each with precise, regular vertical façade divisions; the ground floor is taller than the upper two floors (approximately 1.5 times the height), with a clear volumetric distinction. The upper two floors are organized into a strict grid of five horizontal bays and three vertical subdivisions per bay, articulated by vertical and horizontal mullions roughly 6 cm thick. Spandrels are present as opaque horizontal bands separating each floor, establishing a rhythmic façade grid. The ground floor is fully glazed with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—creating maximum connection between interior and exterior, with warm lighting and direct interior visibility. There is a distinct visual transition between the ground floor and upper levels: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, while upper floors maintain a disciplined rectilinear grid of translucent glass and defined mullions.
