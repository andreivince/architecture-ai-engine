A rectilinear glass building with five visible floors, each articulated in a strict modular grid defined by pronounced vertical mullions approximately 10 cm thick and horizontal divisions creating clear spandrels between floors; the primary façade rhythm consists of seven horizontal bays with each floor further divided into vertical subdivisions by these consistent mullions, except at the base. The upper floors use standard-height modules, while the ground floor is distinctly taller—appearing nearly double the height of the other levels—and wrapped in uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, forming a seamless glass envelope that reveals interior spaces and produces a clear volumetric distinction. The massing incorporates multiple cantilevered boxes, but the grid and rhythm remain consistent across all upper floors, with no single floor diverging in material, while the ground floor’s smooth, mullion-free glass and visibly warmer interior lighting establish a distinct visual transition at the base. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and this base should be rendered as uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with explicit contrast to the subdivided upper elevations.
