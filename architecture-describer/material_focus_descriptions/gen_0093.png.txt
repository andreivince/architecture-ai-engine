A cubic modernist building with three visible floors, the upper two floors identical in rhythm and massing, each with a strict curtain wall fa√ßade divided into 8 horizontal bays and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay, separated by thin vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick and horizontal spandrels marking floor breaks; on the upper levels, the glazing modules are narrow and tall, with prominent gridded mullion structure. The ground floor is clearly differentiated and double-height, occupying about twice the vertical dimension of the typical upper floors, featuring uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, producing a smooth, continuous appearance; interior is visibly illuminated with warm lighting, offering clear interior visibility and signaling volumetric distinction from the upper grid pattern. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating a distinct visual transition and base-to-mass contrast.
