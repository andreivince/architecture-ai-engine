A slender modern tower with 11 visible floors, the façade is strictly rectilinear with a consistent grid of glazing and balcony modules; upper floors (2–11) are subdivided into three vertical bays on the broad faces, each bay divided by metallic vertical mullions approximately 10 cm thick and horizontal spandrels at each floor level, producing a pronounced floor break rhythm. Each upper floor features projecting balconies on each bay corner, set within white horizontal and vertical frame elements that visually reinforce the module grid. No variation in transparency across upper floors: they use standard-height glazing and a tight vertical and horizontal mullion grid throughout. The ground floor is visually and volumetrically distinct—single, double-height space (~1.5–2x the floors above), with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base extending fully corner-to-corner and NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing. Warm lighting and clear interior visibility at street level create a strong contrast with the upper regularized façade; there is a distinct visual transition between the smooth, mullion-free ground floor and the strictly gridded, mullion-marked upper levels. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
