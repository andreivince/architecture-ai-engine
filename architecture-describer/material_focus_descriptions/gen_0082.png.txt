A rectilinear glass building with five visible floors, each floor except the ground is of uniform height while the ground floor is clearly taller and volumetrically distinct. The façade exhibits a strict vertical and horizontal grid, with each floor above the ground subdivided into 6–8 horizontal bays and 4–5 vertical subdivisions per bay, defined by slender vertical mullions approximately 6 cm thick and pronounced horizontal spandrels at each slab. The upper floors have a rhythmic repetition of glass modules bounded by these mullions and spandrels, forming a clear curtainwall grid. No clear floor is different in material or transparency, except the ground floor. The ground floor is unmistakably double-height, with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, flooded with warm lighting allowing full interior visibility and creating a strong volumetric distinction from the upper grid; a distinct visual transition separates this smooth, mullion-free glass base from the finely divided rectilinear grid above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
