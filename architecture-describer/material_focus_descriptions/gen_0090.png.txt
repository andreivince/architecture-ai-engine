A rectilinear building with five visible floors, exhibiting predominantly cubic massing, each facade articulated by a highly regularized grid of clear and frosted glazing panels. The ground floor is clearly taller—approximately double the height of the upper stories—with fully uninterrupted transparent glazing along the base: NO vertical mullions or divisions on the ground floor glass. The upper four floors are identical in height, each subdivided horizontally into 8 bays and vertically into 4 subdivisions per bay per floor, using slender mullions approximately 7–10 cm thick; the rhythm is strict with no visual spandrels or floor breaks, though there is a faint banding due to the panelized system. The ground floor delivers a distinct visual transition and volumetric distinction, differing completely from above by featuring smooth, mullion-free glass panels—maximizing transparency and allowing clear interior visibility (note: no warm lighting visible in this daylight context). The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass; this sharply contrasts the upper grid pattern, which is defined by frequent, thin vertical and horizontal mullions creating a rigorous modular pattern. Make the base visually distinct from the gridded upper levels by emphasizing uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base and an explicit contrast in both height and façade articulation.
