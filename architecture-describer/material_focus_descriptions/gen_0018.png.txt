A glass-clad rectilinear building with three visible floors, clearly articulated in massing; the façade displays a strict modular grid pattern with each floor subdivided into eight horizontal bays and five vertical glass panels per bay, demarcated by uniform vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick and continuous horizontal spandrel lines between floors; the upper floors are uniform in height, while the ground floor is double-height (approximately twice the height of upper floors), distinguished by uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a smooth, visually open volumetric distinction; warm lighting within enhances interior visibility on the ground floor, making it appear welcoming and dramatically taller than the upper stacked grid; a distinct visual transition exists between the seamless ground floor façade and the rigorously subdivided upper stories. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
