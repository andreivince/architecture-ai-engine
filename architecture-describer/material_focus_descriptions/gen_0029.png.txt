A rectilinear building with three visible floors, each floor forming a precise horizontal band; the ground floor is clearly taller—approximately twice the height of the upper floors. The façade features a strict orthogonal grid of slender vertical mullions (about 6 cm thick) and horizontal divisions forming continuous floor breaks between stories. The upper two floors present 11 vertical bays on the primary elevation, each subdivided by mullions into glazing modules approximately 1:3 in width-to-height ratio; spandrels run between floors, clearly marking each horizontal break. All upper floor glazing is separated into modules by mullions and spandrels, creating a rigid regular rhythm, while the ground floor differs dramatically: it uses uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, maximizing clear views inside—this base zone is volumetrically distinguished and visually open, accentuated by the presence of warm lighting and high interior visibility. There is a distinct visual transition between the ground level and upper grid pattern. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
