A cubic modern building with four visible floors, each clearly delineated; the ground floor measures approximately twice the height of upper floors, which are uniform and low in comparison. The main façade presents a strict rectilinear grid, composed of six horizontal bays per side and three vertical subdivisions per bay on each upper floor, with visible matte aluminum mullions approximately 8 cm thick and horizontal spandrels between each floor. The upper floors employ repetitive frosted-glass modules with a rigid rhythm, interrupted only by a few open corner balconies on select upper corners. The ground floor, by stark contrast, features uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping around the base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a volumetric distinction and a distinct visual transition; warm interior lighting enhances interior visibility and emphasizes public character. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—explicitly: mullions and spandrels are present on all upper floors, but the base is defined by uninterrupted transparent glazing and clear volumetric separation.
