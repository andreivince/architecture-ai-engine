A rectilinear glass cube building with five visible floors, featuring a ground floor that is distinctly taller than the others, approximately double-height relative to the upper floors; the ground floor façade uses uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, yielding a smooth, seamless glass appearance at the base, which contrasts sharply with the upper floors’ strict rectilinear grid. The upper four floors utilize a uniform curtain wall façade with regularly spaced vertical mullions, each about 6 cm thick, and horizontal spandrels marking clear floor breaks; the visible rhythm is set by seven horizontal bays per façade face, each floor further subdivided vertically by the mullion grid. The upper-floor glass is semi-opaque with a repetitive module structure, while the ground floor displays warm interior lighting with visible furniture and volumetric openness, ensuring interior visibility and a distinct visual transition at the base. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; emphasize the pronounced difference between the transparent, open base and the structured, subdivided upper façade.
