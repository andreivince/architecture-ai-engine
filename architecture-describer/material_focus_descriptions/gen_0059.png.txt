The building features a rectilinear massing with 3 visible floors; the ground floor is clearly taller than the upper floors and volumetrically distinct. The façade uses a strict vertical and horizontal grid, with the upper levels articulated by a repetitive curtain wall system: 7 horizontal bays across the primary elevation, each subdivided vertically by mullions approximately 7–10 cm thick, forming slender glazed modules. No spandrels or visible floor breaks are present, emphasizing uninterrupted vertical rhythm. The ground floor is single-height but significantly taller than the floors above, clad with smooth, uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions appear on the ground floor glazing—establishing an explicit visual transition from the upper façade’s fine grid. Interior lighting and activity are not visibly present; focus is on the volumetric and envelope distinction. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. Contrasts between the curtain wall mullion rhythm above and the seamless transparent base are mandatory, clearly demarcating the base, grid, and overall massing.
