A rectilinear glass pavilion with a strict curtain wall façade, featuring four visible floors; the ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately double the height of the upper floors—with uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping the base, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, maximum interior visibility, and a visually continuous volumetric distinction from the upper grid pattern; upper floors have a precise grid of slender black mullions, approximately 5 cm thick, forming 7 horizontal bays and 4 vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, with visible horizontal spandrels marking each floor break and establishing a consistent rhythm; there is a clear visual transition at the ground floor, which MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper façade’s mullioned grid; interior on ground level is warmly lit and fully visible, reinforcing its unique double-height and transparent character compared to the repetitive, module-rich articulation above.
