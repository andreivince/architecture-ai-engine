A square-plan modernist building with five visible floors, where each floor above the ground exhibits a uniform grid façade, comprised of horizontal bays split into five modules per side and four vertical subdivisions per bay, delineated by pronounced vertical and horizontal mullions approximately 8 cm thick; the upper four floors present a strict rhythm of aluminum or steel panels alternating with transparent glazing in each module, and contain flush spandrels with no visible floor breaks except for an occasional setback at corners for open balconies. The ground floor is clearly differentiated: it is single-height but volumetrically distinct due to deep recesses at its base, and utilizes opaque cladding with NO uninterrupted transparent glazing, NO vertical mullions, and NO floor-to-ceiling glass panels; ground level modules are visually contextualized by their solid, continuous metal surface, lacking the grid pattern or rhythmic mullion definition of upper floors. The ground floor MUST appear lower and distinctly solid compared to the upper levels, providing a stark visual and material transition and eliminating any hint of uninterrupted transparent glazing or volumetric transparency at the base—emphasize the robust, mullion-free cladding at ground level, sharply contrasted with the mullion-defined, systematic façade grid and modular massing above.
