A rectilinear mid-rise structure with visible massing steps, the building has five above-ground floors, with the ground floor clearly taller — approximately 1.5 times the height of upper levels — and volumetrically set apart; the façade consists of a strict vertical and horizontal grid of approximately 9 bays across the main elevation and 5 visible vertical subdivisions per floor, clad in large panels of light glazing separated by metal mullions estimated at 8–10 cm wide; mullions run continuously up the façade, but at the ground floor, the glazing is smooth and uninterrupted, with NO vertical mullions or divisions, providing uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, a distinct visual transition from the upper stories; there are no spandrels or expressed floor breaks, only the clean grid, with windows of varied transparency and occasional recessed modules on upper floors; moments of warm lighting and interior activity are visible at ground and some upper levels; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, explicitly emphasizing the base, grid, and massing distinction.
