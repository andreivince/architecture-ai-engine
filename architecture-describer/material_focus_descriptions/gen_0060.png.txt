A rectilinear building with 6 visible floors, the ground floor distinctly taller—approximately double the height of upper floors—and clearly demarcated from above by a pronounced visual transition. The façade comprises a strict grid of transparent glazing with metal mullions, each approximately 6 cm thick, defining a rhythmic pattern of 7 horizontal bays across and 6 vertical subdivisions per bay on each upper floor; no visible spandrels, and all upper floors exhibit identical module structure and height with no differentiation in glazing transparency or material. The ground floor stands out: it features uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions, allowing full interior visibility and soft, warm lighting; doors and minimal horizontal breaks are present but the volumetric clarity and smoothness of this base are unmistakable. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. Explicitly separate the continuous, transparent, and open base from the repetitive, subdivided grid of the upper massing to ensure an unambiguous architectural hierarchy.
