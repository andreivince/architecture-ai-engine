A three-story building with a rectilinear massing composed of interlocking glass façade modules; the structure features a total of three visible floors, with the ground floor clearly taller—approximately 1.75 times the height of the upper floors. The façade is articulated with a sharp vertical rhythm through pronounced vertical mullions approximately 7-8 cm thick on all upper floors, segmented into five major horizontal bays and each bay subdivided vertically into four distinct sections per floor. There is no evidence of spandrels or horizontal floor breaks interrupting the vertical glazing pattern above the ground level. The ground floor is distinctly different: it is double-height, characterized by uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base with NO vertical mullions or divisions, creating a continuous glass surface—emphasize this volumetric distinction and absence of vertical grid texture. Warm lighting and significant interior visibility are present at the ground level, sharply contrasting the regular, gridded, mullioned upper stories. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; make the transition from the transparent base to the mullioned upper façade a distinct visual break in the architectural language.
