A rectilinear glass office building with five visible floors, where the ground floor is explicitly double-height—appearing roughly twice the height of each upper floor—and features uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, ensuring clear volumetric distinction; clear warm lighting and visible interior activate the base. Above the ground floor, the façade consists of a precise, strict vertical and horizontal grid: each floor is divided into seven horizontal bays per elevation, with each bay subdivided vertically by slender aluminum-clad mullions approximately 8 cm thick, and every floor marked by horizontal floor breaks—continuous horizontal spandrels separating floors with no visible projection. The upper four floors are uniform in height and material, with transparent regular glazing and an identical grid rhythm, with no differentiation in material or transparency. The massing is cuboid with sharp 90-degree corners, and grid pattern is rigorous, with a strong visual separation between the base and upper levels. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating a distinct visual transition between base and upper façade.
