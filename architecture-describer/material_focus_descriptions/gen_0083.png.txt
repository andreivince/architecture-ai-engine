A rectilinear building of 6 visible floors with irregular massing featuring sharply cantilevered and recessed volumetric modules, each floor stepping in and out horizontally. The upper five floors are each subdivided into a clear grid of approximately 3 horizontal bays per primary façade segment, with visible vertical and horizontal joints forming panels roughly 1.5 meters by 1.5 meters. The façade uses a modular cladding system with mullions and panel joints approximately 5 cm thick, set in a consistent orthogonal rhythm, occasionally interrupted by windows of varying sizes placed asymmetrically within the panels. Spandrels are minimally expressed, with no strong floor breaks except for deep reveals at terrace setbacks. The ground floor is visibly taller—double-height compared to upper floors—and separated from upper massing by a strong visual transition: uninterrupted transparent glazing at base wraps the perimeter, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, allowing full interior visibility and emphasizing the volumetric distinction. Warm lighting and clear sightlines into the interior reinforce its separation from the gridded, opaque cladding above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—this contrast is crucial for accurate generation.
