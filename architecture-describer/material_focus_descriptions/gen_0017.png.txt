A rectilinear building with five visible floors, each floor of equal height except for the base; the ground floor is distinctly taller than the upper stories, measuring approximately 1.5 times the height and featuring a volumetric distinction. The façade is defined by a strict rectilinear grid: each floor contains five horizontal bays and four vertical subdivisions per bay, separated by black aluminum mullions approximately 5 cm thick. The upper four floors exhibit a precise pattern of glazing and opaque spandrels, with each module arranged in a repetitive rhythm and visible vertical and horizontal mullion lines creating a uniform grid. No spandrels or floor breaks interrupt the overall grid. The ground floor contrasts sharply, presenting uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping the entire base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, resulting in clear interior visibility and a smooth visual transition from the upper stories—this MUST read as “uninterrupted transparent glazing at base” and “distinct visual transition” compared to the structured grid above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; emphasize the contrast between the open base and the modular, gridded upper volume.
