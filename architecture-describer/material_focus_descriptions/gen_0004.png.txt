A rectilinear commercial mid-rise with 8 visible floors, the building massing articulates strong horizontal slab extensions creating a staggered, modular composition; upper floors are set back at irregular intervals, generating a rhythm of projecting and recessed volumes. The façade is defined by a precise aluminum and glass curtain wall system with a grid of 3 to 5 horizontal bays per segment and 2 to 3 vertical subdivisions per floor, mullions at approximately 7–10 cm thickness, and NO visible spandrels or opaque floor breaks, presenting continuous glazing between floors. The ground floor is distinctly double-height, significantly taller than all upper floors, with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—and fully smooth glass panels wrapping the perimeter. Warm interior lighting and maximal visibility provide a pronounced volumetric distinction at street level, contrasting sharply with the upper grid pattern, and creating a clear visual transition between base and tower: The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
