Rectilinear commercial building with a total of two visible floors; the ground floor is explicitly taller than the upper floor, presenting a marked contrast in volumetric distinction. The façade uses a strict modular grid: horizontally, there are 8 bays articulated by prominent vertical mullions approximately 10 cm thick, evenly spaced on both floors except at the ground floor corners, ensuring a clear, rhythmic elevation. Each floor is subdivided vertically into 2 equal window bands per bay, delineated by thin transoms. Upper floor glazing is set within a grid of deep black mullions and includes continuous spandrels at the slab level, creating horizontal floor breaks. The ground floor employs uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, maximizing glass panel width and height; this glazing reveals a warmly lit, visibly open interior and is visually separated from the upper grid by faint shadow gap detailing at plinth level. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—this distinct visual transition between uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and rigorously gridded, mullion-dominated upper floors is essential to the massing and architectural intent.
