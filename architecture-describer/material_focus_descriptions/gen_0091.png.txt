A rectilinear glass office building with five visible floors, the façade employs a strict grid of seven horizontal bays and five vertical subdivisions per floor, for a pronounced modular rhythm; mullions on the upper four floors are metallic, approximately 6 cm thick, forming a regular lattice with clear spandrels between each floor, while the vertical mullions and spandrels organize the glazing distinctly — but the ground floor is a double-height volume, entirely wrapped in large, uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, presenting a smooth, continuous glass surface that sharply contrasts the subdivided upper modules. Ground floor glazing reveals warmly lit interiors with high visibility and contains the primary entry, clearly demarcating a volumetric base from the rigid grid above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating a distinct visual transition and ensuring the base, façade grid, and massing are treated as separate explicit architectural elements.
