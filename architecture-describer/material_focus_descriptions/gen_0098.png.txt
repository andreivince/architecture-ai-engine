A rectangular modernist building with three visible floors, with the ground floor clearly taller—approximately double the height of the upper floors—emphasizing volumetric distinction and hierarchy. The façade uses a precise grid of translucent glass modules: each floor subdivided into eight vertical bays, each bay split by slim vertical mullions approximately 10 cm thick, creating a consistent rhythm on the upper two floors. The ground floor is defined by uninterrupted transparent glazing without vertical mullions or divisions, forming a smooth expanse of glass; interior spaces are brightly illuminated with warm lighting, and furnishings are clearly visible, highlighting the continuous transparency at the base. There are no visible spandrels or horizontal floor breaks, except for the strong visual transition between the ground floor and the upper grid-patterned façades. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; make the distinct visual transition from base to upper levels explicit, enforcing architectural contrast through massing and façade articulation.
