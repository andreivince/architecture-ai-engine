A rectilinear building with 8 visible floors displays pronounced modular massing, each floor offset to create a staggered, block-like rhythm across the façade; upper floors are arranged in horizontal bays, generally 4 to 6 per floor depending on set-back modules, with each module subdivided vertically by glass and aluminum panels separated by mullions approximately 5–7 cm thick, with no visible spandrels between floors and no pronounced floor breaks except for apparent set-back terraces. The ground floor is explicitly double-height and visually distinct: it features uninterrupted transparent glazing around its perimeter—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—offering volumetric distinction and exposing warmly lit interior spaces with high visibility, in sharp contrast to the upper grid pattern with regular mullions and modules. The visual transition between base and upper floors is clear and dramatic. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; emphasize the transparent, open base and the articulated, stacked upper modules for maximum architectural fidelity.
