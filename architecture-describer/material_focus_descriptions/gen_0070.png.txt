A rectilinear building with a glass curtain wall façade, showing three clearly visible floors; the ground floor is distinctly taller (approximately double height) compared to the upper floors. The façade is structured in a strict vertical and horizontal grid, with each floor divided into roughly eight horizontal bays and each bay subdivided vertically by thin (approximately 6 cm) black mullions; prominent vertical mullions are continuous from second floor upwards, with each bay further divided into four vertical modules per floor. There are pronounced horizontal spandrels or opaque bands between floors, giving clear floor breaks throughout the upper levels. The ground floor is defined by uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—contrasted against the mullioned grid above, with warm interior lighting and visible furniture providing significant volumetric and atmospheric distinction. The massing includes boxy cantilevered modules projecting at various points on each floor, reinforcing a stepped rhythm. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating a distinct visual transition between the base and the upper levels.
