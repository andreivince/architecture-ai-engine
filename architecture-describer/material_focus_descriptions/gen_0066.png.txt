A rectilinear glass-clad building with five visible floors, each upper floor presenting a precise grid façade subdivided into six horizontal bays and three vertical subdivisions per floor, defined by slender vertical mullions approximately 6 cm thick and no visible spandrels; the massing is characterized by staggered modules that create offsets, but the glazing rhythm and grid rigor is consistent except where the massing steps. The ground floor is distinctly taller—double-height relative to typical upper floors—with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, explicitly NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, resulting in smooth glass panels and a clear volumetric and visual break from the upper floors’ tight grid pattern. Warm lighting at the base increases interior visibility, accentuating public program, and the transition between ground and upper levels is unmistakable, as the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; this distinct visual transition between base and upper floors is mandatory for model fidelity.
