A rectilinear building with two visible floors, strict horizontal massing, and a glazed façade divided by a grid of slender, black vertical mullions approximately 6 cm thick and horizontal transoms, creating a repetitive rhythm of 14 bays across the main elevation; each floor contains vertically subdivided glass modules, with the ground floor clearly taller—almost double the upper floor’s height—exhibiting large, uninterrupted transparent glazing panels at the base with NO vertical mullions or divisions, resulting in a distinct visual transition between floors. The upper floor maintains a regular mullion and glass rhythm, with bay widths narrowly consistent, no spandrel panels or distinct floor breaks visible. The ground floor reveals volumetric distinction through expansive, clear glass, showing warm interior lighting and interior space beyond the façade. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, establishing explicit separation in structural and visual articulation between the base and the upper banded façade.
