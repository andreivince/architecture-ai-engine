Rectilinear glass pavilion with a total of two visible floors; the ground floor is approximately 1.5 times taller than the upper floor, creating a clear volumetric and proportional distinction. The façade is subdivided into a strict vertical and horizontal grid: each elevation has 6 horizontal bays and 2 visible vertical subdivisions per floor, formed by prominent dark metal mullions, each approximately 10 cm thick. The upper floor’s glazing is interrupted by both vertical mullions and horizontal spandrels, generating a rhythmic grid pattern, while the ground floor is entirely different in treatment—its glazing consists of uninterrupted, transparent glass panels that span each bay without any vertical mullions, no spandrels, and complete visual continuity along the base. There is a sharp transition between the base and upper grid, making the difference explicit. Interior is clearly visible through the ground floor with potential for warm lighting; upper floors are more opaque or reflective. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. Make the distinction between the transparent, taller ground floor base and the tight, regular mullioned upper floor grid strikingly obvious in both glazing and massing.
