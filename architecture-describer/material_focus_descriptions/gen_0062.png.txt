A rectilinear glass tower with 14 visible floors, the façade structured by a strict grid of thin vertical mullions approximately 8 cm wide and regular horizontal divisions forming a rigid rhythm; each floor above the base is subdivided into 4 vertical bays and 7 horizontal modules, separated by clear spandrels at each slab. The ground floor is distinctly double-height, visually taller than upper levels, and encased in uninterrupted transparent glazing at base — NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing — producing a volumetric and material break from above; interior illuminated by warm lighting, high transparency, and complete absence of the upper façade’s grid pattern. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, forming a distinct visual transition between the transparent, open base and the regimented, module-driven upper stories.
