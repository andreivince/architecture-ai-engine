A rectilinear glass building with three visible floors; the ground floor is approximately twice the height of the upper floors and strongly distinguished from the rest of the façade. The façade is articulated by a strict steel grid with vertical mullions approximately 10 cm thick, forming a rhythmic pattern of 6 horizontal bays and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay on all upper floors. All upper floor modules use clear glazing with visible horizontal spandrels at each floor break and consistent vertical mullions. In contrast, the ground floor features uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, allowing for maximum visibility and a visually open effect; interior spaces and warm lighting are visible, and the ground floor volume stands out as both double-height and structurally different. The transition between the base and the upper grid is sharp and explicit, forming a distinct visual transition, and the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
