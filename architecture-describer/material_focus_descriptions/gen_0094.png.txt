A rectilinear building with five visible floors: the ground floor is distinctly taller (double-height, approximately 1.8 times the upper floor height), creating a strong volumetric base. The façade features a rigid orthogonal grid of translucent and transparent glass panels, defined by aluminum mullions roughly 6–8 cm thick, forming a precise pattern of horizontal bays (six per main façade) and vertical subdivisions (two per bay per floor above the ground). All upper floors have consistently spaced vertical and horizontal mullions, with no spandrels or solid floor breaks visible, maintaining a strict modular rhythm. Several upper modules on each floor have clear or recessed balcony insets, but the overall grid remains uninterrupted except for these. Critically, the ground floor is enclosed by uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—distinct from the upper façade modules—with full-height panels allowing maximum interior visibility, warm lighting, and a clear volumetric and material separation from the upper structure. The transition from the base to the upper grid must be explicit: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, enforcing a strong distinction in façade articulation.
