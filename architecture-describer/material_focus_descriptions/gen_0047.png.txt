A rectilinear tower with a glass and metal façade, 8 visible floors; ground floor is single-height, visibly taller than upper floors (estimated 1.5 times their height), and the ground level is clad in smooth panels including large, uninterrupted transparent glazing at the building base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a distinct visual transition; interior warm lighting is visible at the base, enhancing volumetric distinction and interior transparency. Upper floors show a strict modular grid of curtainwall glazing with vertical mullions approximately 7 cm thick and narrow horizontal spandrels between floors; the façade on each side displays 4 horizontal bays per floor, each bay subdivided vertically into 2 window modules per bay, reinforcing a regular grid rhythm. No ground floor spandrels are visible, while floor breaks are clearly present above, separating the base from the upper massing. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
