A rectilinear glass building with four visible above-ground floors, the lowest of which is clearly a taller, double-height ground floor; the façade is entirely clad in transparent and translucent glazing modules arranged in a strict orthogonal grid, with the upper three floors each subdivided into 6 horizontal bays and 3 vertical floors, yielding a vertical rhythm of 18 modules per main façade; each glazed module on the upper floors is bordered by anodized aluminum frames with thin mullions approximately 4 cm wide, creating crisp grid lines; there are no visible horizontal spandrels or pronounced floor breaks, giving the massing a seamless cubic effect; several volumes cantilever or offset slightly at the upper levels, reinforcing a modular massing articulation; most critical, the ground floor is visually and volumetrically distinct with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, and an absence of grid—creating a smooth glass surface entirely different from the upper grid pattern, maximizing clear views into the warmly-lit interior which is clearly visible and open; explicit contrast: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating a distinct visual transition to the regular articulated grid of the upper floors.
