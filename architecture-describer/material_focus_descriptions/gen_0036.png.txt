A six-story building with a complex, interlocking massing of cubic modules is depicted; the façade is composed of rectilinear volumes which shift horizontally, creating a strong rhythm with alternating projections and recesses. The visible façade module varies per floor, but most floors present between 4 and 6 horizontal bays per elevation, each subdivided vertically into either full-height glass or solid parapet panels; no continuous vertical mullions unify the elevation, but each glass panel has approximately 6–8 cm thick, minimal aluminum mullions visible only between glazing sections. Spandrels are absent, so the glass extends floor-to-ceiling in each bay; no floor breaks visually separate the levels. The fourth floor features a localized, green-tinted glass bay, distinguishing it from the rest via color, but not height or material. The ground floor is explicitly taller—approximately double-height relative to the upper stories—and its glass façade uses uninterrupted transparent glazing without any vertical mullions or divisions, giving a seamless visual wash that contrasts sharply with the grid of stacked modules above. The base exudes volumetric distinction with smooth, mullion-free glass, extensive interior visibility, and warm lighting, creating a clear, distinct visual transition between the open, transparent ground floor and the stacked, articulated grid pattern of the upper massing. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
