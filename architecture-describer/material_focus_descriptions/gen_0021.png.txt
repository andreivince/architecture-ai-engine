A rectilinear building with clear massing articulation, comprising two visible floors plus partial mezzanine volumes, with the ground floor approximately 1.6x taller than the upper floor; façade composed entirely of rectilinear glass modules arranged in a strict vertical grid, each module separated by dark, regular mullions approximately 7 cm thick, spanning both vertically and horizontally; the upper levels exhibit a strong rhythm of 6 horizontal bays and up to 4 vertical subdivisions per floor, interrupted occasionally by deeper projecting or recessed modules; the upper façade has no spandrels, but floor plates are demarcated by glass continuity with periodic vertical interruptions; notably, the ground floor is visually and volumetrically distinct, featuring uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—the base appears as smooth, continuous glass panels, with warm lighting and high interior visibility, establishing a clear contrast and a distinct visual transition from the rigid upper grid; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, demanding explicit separation of the base and upper façade rhythm and massing.
