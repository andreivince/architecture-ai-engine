Three-story rectilinear building with a cubic massing, clad entirely in vertically oriented white metal panels on all façades, with consistent narrow vertical joints/mullions approximately 5 cm thick defining a precise grid pattern; ground floor distinctly set apart by its taller height (roughly 1.5x upper floors), deeper volumetric recesses, and extensive uninterrupted transparent glazing, especially on the main elevation—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a clear, smooth band of glass with visible interior depth and warm lighting, unlike the upper two floors where glazing is subdivided into regular vertical bays of differing widths and clear mullion rhythm, punctuated by projecting solid wall sections and occasional balconies; no visible spandrels, all curtain wall areas span floor-to-floor; upper floor modules do not align perfectly with ground level voids, emphasizing horizontal breaks and modular irregularity; the façade exhibits six to eight vertical bays per elevation and upper-story window subdivisions of varying size, but the ground floor remains a transparent void with a distinct visual transition; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, making the base, façade rhythm, and volumetric articulation absolutely distinct.
