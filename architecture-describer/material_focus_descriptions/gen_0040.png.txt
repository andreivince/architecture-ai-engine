A single-story glass pavilion with 1 visible floor, featuring a horizontally elongated, slightly curved massing; the façade is defined by a grid of glazing set within thin vertical mullions, each approximately 6 cm thick, creating 19 vertical bays across the primary frontage with no visible horizontal spandrels or floor breaks. The rhythm of the façade is strictly vertical, with full-height glass panels, and no subdivisions within each bay. The ground floor is clearly taller than conventional floors, double-height, with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a distinct visual transition between the smooth, mullion-free base and the finely gridded upper curtain wall. The ground floor reveals interior warm lighting and volumetric openness, emphasizing a transparent, inviting appearance. The massing’s purity is maintained by the continuous glass perimeter and absence of decorative elements. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—enforce this base/grid contrast without exception.
