A rectilinear, glass-clad building with two clearly visible floors; the upper floor is defined by a strict façade grid of approximately 12 horizontal bays, each subdivided by vertical mullions spaced uniformly at about 1.2 meters, with mullion thickness around 5 cm, and no visible horizontal spandrels disrupting the full floor-to-ceiling glazing; the ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately double the upper floor height—presenting a volumetric distinction and complete transparency achieved through uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, resulting in a smooth expanse of glass and warm interior lighting with high visibility inside; there is a clear and explicit visual transition between the seamless, mullion-free glass of the ground floor and the rigid mullioned grid pattern of the upper floor façades; the massing is clean and box-like with no ornamentation or setbacks. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
