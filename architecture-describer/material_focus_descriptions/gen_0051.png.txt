A rectilinear glass office building with four visible floors, the ground floor measuring approximately double the height of upper floors, exhibiting a total of six vertical bays across the façade with a regular grid of thin vertical mullions, each mullion about 8 cm thick, and horizontal subdivisions aligning at each floor level; no spandrels are present, and all upper levels repeat the same grid pattern with clear glass panels between the mullions. The ground floor is clearly demarcated as double-height, with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—creating a distinct visual and volumetric transition from the upper grid; interior is warmly lit, with high transparency and visible activity contrasting strongly against the regular, subdivided upper façade. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and the visual distinction between the base and upper modules must be explicit.
