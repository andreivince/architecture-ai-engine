A rectilinear building with five visible floors, massing articulated by horizontally offset modular volumes, each floor shifting laterally to create a staggered façade; the ground floor is clearly taller—approximately 1.5 times the height of the upper floors—and features smooth, uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, providing full volumetric distinction, warm interior lighting, and clear interior visibility, while the upper four floors exhibit a strict curtain wall grid with regular vertical mullions approximately 6 cm thick and horizontal divisions at each floor slab, forming a clear spandrel break between floors; each upper floor consists of six horizontal bays and four vertical subdivisions per bay, establishing a uniform, rhythmic façade, with no individual floor differing in material or transparency except the base, which MUST appear taller and distinct—the contrast between the uninterrupted ground floor glass and the gridded, mullioned pattern above creates a distinct visual transition that must be explicitly rendered.
