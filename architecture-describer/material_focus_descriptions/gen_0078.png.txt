Single-story building with one visible floor, rectilinear massing, and a strict glass-and-steel façade articulated by a precise grid. The façade is subdivided into 11 vertical bays along the long side and 4 bays along the short side; each bay is further divided vertically by thin metal mullions approximately 6 cm thick, with no spandrels or visible floor breaks. All façade modules have equal rectilinear proportions, forming a consistent vertical and horizontal rhythm. No bay is differentiated by material or transparency, and there are no visibly distinct floors above the base. The ground floor is not double-height but is fully glazed with continuous, uninterrupted transparent glazing panels reaching from pavement to ceiling, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing at prominent entrance areas, resulting in maximum visual transparency into a warmly lit interior. There is a distinct visual transition where the upper grid pattern of mullions meets the base’s smooth glass, making the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, clearly emphasizing volumetric and façade differentiation at the base.
