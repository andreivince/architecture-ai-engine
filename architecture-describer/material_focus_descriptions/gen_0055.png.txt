A rectilinear glass building of four visible floors with articulated massing, each primary façade organized into a strict grid of vertical modules delineated by dark mullions approximately 8 cm thick; each floor above the base is subdivided into regular vertical bays—typically 6 to 7 per main section—framed by floor-to-ceiling glazing panels with horizontal spandrel breaks marking slab lines between levels; the ground floor is distinctly taller, roughly double the height of upper floors, and features smooth, uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base with NO vertical mullions or divisions—emphasizing a clear volumetric and material transition from the gridded upper stories; no spandrels or mullions are present at the ground floor, maximizing interior visibility and giving the base a seamless, open character; all upper floors repeat the regular grid with consistent rhythm and clear floor breaks, while the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating a strong visual contrast at the base.
