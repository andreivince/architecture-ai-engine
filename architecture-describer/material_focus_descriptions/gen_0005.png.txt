A distinctly modular rectilinear building with four visible floors, where the ground floor is clearly double-height and appears approximately twice as tall as each upper floor; the fa√ßade consists of a strongly gridded curtain wall system with regular vertical mullions approximately 10 cm thick on the upper three floors, subdividing each horizontal bay into narrow vertical sections, with six horizontal bays visible on the main elevation and three to four vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, while no spandrels disrupt the rhythm between floors; glazing above the ground floor is set in a rigid, repetitive grid with each panel matching the floor height and divided by dark mullions, whereas the ground floor presents fully uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, creating a clear volumetric distinction and allowing warm lighting and interior activity to be visibly highlighted; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, enforcing a distinct visual transition at the base and emphasizing a hierarchy between the transparent, inviting base and the orderly, segmented upper massing.
