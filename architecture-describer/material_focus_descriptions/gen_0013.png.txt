A rectilinear glass building with three visible floors, the ground floor clearly taller—double-height—than the two above, with a distinct volumetric and material break at the base. The façade is organized into nine vertical bays spanning the width, each subdivided vertically into three modules per floor by slender black mullions approximately 6 cm thick; horizontal spandrels are absent, allowing the glazing rhythm to run continuously from floor to floor. The upper floors feature a strict grid of vertical and horizontal mullions forming a repetitive rectilinear pattern, while the ground floor is entirely different, comprised of uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—creating a smooth, seamless glass perimeter. Warm interior lighting and clear volumetric distinction emphasize the difference between base and upper floors. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, establishing a distinct visual transition between the transparent base and the regularized grid above.
