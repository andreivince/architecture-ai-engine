A rectilinear building with three visible floors, each floor of equal height except the ground floor, which is marginally taller, forms a cuboid massing with projecting box volumes on the top and side ends; the façade is strictly modular, divided by thin vertical mullions (3–4 cm thick) and horizontal divisions between each floor creating a pronounced grid. Each visible elevation contains 12 horizontal bays per floor and three clear vertical subdivisions, producing a repetitive rhythm of uniform translucent panels between the mullions, with metal spandrels aligning at each floor line. The ground floor is distinctly taller and defined by fully uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on the ground floor glazing—creating a visually smooth, transparent base, while upper floors maintain the dense vertical mullion and spandrel pattern. The ground floor must appear volumetrically distinct and higher than upper floors, with larger, clear glass panels and a pronounced absence of the upper grid, resulting in a clear contrast: uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, dense vertical mullions and regular façade grid above. The visual transition between base and upper stories is explicit—the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
