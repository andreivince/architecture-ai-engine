A rectilinear mid-rise building with 6 visible floors, the ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately double the height of the typical upper stories and visually set apart by uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, granting volumetric distinction and high interior visibility with evident warm lighting; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. The upper five floors each follow a strict grid of glazing modules divided by vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick and horizontal spandrels of similar profile, generating a uniform façade rhythm with 7 horizontal bays and 6 clear vertical subdivisions per floor. No floor breaks are apparent, but on the southeast corner, multiple stacked balcony modules protrude. The massing remains cubic with sharp edges, and the distinction between base and shaft is explicit: the ground floor’s seamless glass forms a strong visual transition against the repetitive upper grid articulated by prominent vertical and horizontal divisions.
