A cubic, modular building with four visibly stacked floors, the façade composed of staggered horizontal and vertical modules clad in metallic panels with irregular window placements; horizontal massing varies per level, creating overhangs and recessed bays. Each upper floor has approximately three to four horizontal bays with window modules set in a visually rhythmic but non-uniform grid; glazing is flush, mullions are thin (approximately 4 cm width), and spandrels are absent, emphasizing a continuous cladding interrupted only by windows. No single upper floor is visually distinct by height or transparency, but the massing shifts horizontally, producing a volumetric step-back pattern. The ground floor is a full double-height space, with uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping all visible sides—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, resulting in a smooth glass surface and a clear volumetric distinction from the upper grid pattern. The ground floor features warm interior lighting and high visibility into the open-plan space. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, marking a distinct visual transition between base and stacked upper volumes.
