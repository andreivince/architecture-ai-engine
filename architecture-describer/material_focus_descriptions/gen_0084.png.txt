A rectilinear glass building with four visible floors, the ground floor clearly taller than the upper floors by approximately 1.5x, exhibiting a pronounced volumetric distinction at the base; façade is organized in a strict rectilinear grid, with nine horizontal bays and four vertical subdivisions per floor, defined by thin vertical and horizontal mullions approximately 8 cm thick. The upper three floors each have regular, equally sized modules of glazing subdivided by both vertical mullions and horizontal spandrels at each floor break, creating a strong rhythm; no variation in material or transparency is observed on these upper levels. The ground floor is recessed, double-height, and exclusively features uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, producing a distinct visual transition and greater interior visibility, accentuated by warm lighting from within. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, enforcing a clear contrast in façade articulation and massing.
