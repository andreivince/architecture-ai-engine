A two-story modernist building with rectilinear massing, featuring a glass façade system; the upper floor is subdivided horizontally into 7 bays and vertically into 3, each division articulated with slim vertical mullions approximately 6–7 cm thick and horizontal floor breaks (spandrels) between levels; the upper floor has a consistent rhythm of repeating floor-to-ceiling glazed modules separated by mullions for a strict rectilinear grid pattern, while the columns are not expressed externally and there is no ornamentation. The ground floor is notably taller—approximately double the height of the upper floor—and is defined by uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions across its entire expanse, creating a smooth and fully transparent volumetric distinction. Warm interior lighting on the ground floor enhances interior visibility and emphasizes the volumetric purity of the base, with a clear, distinct visual transition separating the smooth, mullion-free glass of the ground floor from the rigid vertical grid of the upper level. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; the absence of vertical mullions at the base is critical, as is the transition between the transparent base and the gridded upper façade.
