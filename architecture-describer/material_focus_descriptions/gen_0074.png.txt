A cubic glass building with a symmetrical massing composed of three visible floors; the ground floor is distinctly taller, approximately double the height of upper floors, creating strong volumetric distinction. The façade features a tight rectilinear grid of glass modules on the upper two floors, each demarcated by vertical mullions approximately 8–10 cm thick, with every visible elevation composed of four primary bays across each face and five vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, producing a precise repetitive rhythm. The upper levels have clear, evenly spaced vertical and horizontal mullions, with visible spandrels (opaque lower panels) under each transparent glazing module demarcating floor breaks. The ground floor contrasts sharply: it consists of uninterrupted transparent glazing across each bay, NO vertical mullions or divisions on any ground floor glass, revealing warm interior lighting and visible interior spaces, emphasizing openness and transparency. The instruction is strict: The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, making the base visually distinct with a clear transition to the rigid grid above.
