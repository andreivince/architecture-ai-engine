A rectilinear glass building with three visible floors, exhibiting strict stacked massing and a pronounced façade rhythm: the upper two floors feature a uniform grid of vertical and horizontal mullions, 8–10 cm thick, organizing the elevations into approximately 9 horizontal bays and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, with floor breaks marked by darker spandrels between floors; the ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately double the upper floor height—and is defined by uninterrupted transparent glazing with absolutely NO vertical mullions or divisions, creating a seamless volumetric distinction and maximal interior visibility with warm lighting clearly visible; the transition between base and upper levels is abrupt and unambiguous, with the upper grid pattern resuming immediately above the smooth, mullion-free glass at ground level. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and the contrast between this uninterrupted glazing at base and the regimented, subdivided upper levels with spandrels and mullions MUST be explicit, creating a clear and dramatic visual transition.
