A rectilinear modern building with six visible floors, the façade defined by a strict grid of transparent and opaque glazing modules; upper floors are composed of a regular rhythm of horizontal bands divided into five bays per face, each bay vertically subdivided into three sections, separated by thin vertical mullions approximately 5 cm thick and prominent horizontal spandrels at every floor level, creating a strong horizontal emphasis and modular pattern. The ground floor is distinctly double-height, visually much taller than the upper stories, wrapped in uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, providing a volumetric base with smooth glass and maximum interior visibility illuminated by warm lighting, sharply contrasting the subdivided upper grid. Spandrels are absent at the base and the opaque paneling differs in reflectance from above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, demanding explicit visual separation and a distinct transition at the base façade. The massing above features stacking and offset modules with deep horizontal reveals and some interspersed terraces; rooftop level holds vegetation in planters, contrasting the orthogonal rhythm below.
