A rectilinear glass office building with five visible floors, featuring a clear distinction in massing and façade treatment between the ground floor and the upper levels; total height is approximately uniform per floor except for the ground floor, which is visibly taller (double-height, approx. 1.7x the height of any upper floor). The ground floor is defined by uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping around the base, NO vertical mullions or divisions present, with smooth, clear glass panels creating maximum interior visibility and volumetric distinction; warm interior lighting is visible, highlighting the lobby space. Above, the façade is organized into a strict grid of seven horizontal bays and five vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, framed by dark metal mullions approximately 8–10 cm thick, creating regular rhythm and repetition. Mullions and horizontal divisions are evenly spaced on all upper floors, visually breaking each floor using articulated spandrels between the floors; ground floor glazing sharply contrasts this by maintaining a mullion-free, gridless appearance. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. This explicit distinction in ground floor transparency and height, as well as the change in façade rhythm above, MUST be maintained for true architectural fidelity.
