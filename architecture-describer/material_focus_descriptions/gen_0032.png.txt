Rectilinear building with 3 visible floors; ground floor is visibly taller than upper floors (approximately double height), with a pronounced volumetric base, fully wrapped in smooth uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a distinct visual transition from upper floors; upper two floors display a strict orthogonal façade rhythm composed of a regular vertical and horizontal grid of thin mullions (thickness circa 5 cm), forming bays that are 1.5–2 meters wide—each floor divided into 8 horizontal bays and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay, with clear separation between floors but no visible spandrels, only mullion intersections marking floor breaks; upper glazing is less transparent, more reflective, and subdivided by the structural grid, contrasting sharply with the open, mullion-free ground floor; warm interior lighting at ground level enhances transparency and clearly reveals the interior, further differentiating it from upper levels; massing is modular, with upper volumes stepped or offset atop the taller base, emphasizing the base-grid hierarchy; The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, distinct visual transition, absolute contrast between base and upper façade modules.
