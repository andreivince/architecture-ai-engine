A rectilinear building with five visible floors, each floor above the ground is of equal height, while the ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately 1.5 times the height of upper levels. The upper façade is composed of a strict grid of dark metal mullions, approximately 8 cm thick, defining a modular rhythm of five horizontal bays and three vertical subdivisions per floor, with translucent and transparent glazing infill. Spandrels are flush and continuous across the façade, maintaining a rigid grid without pronounced floor breaks. The massing features stacked rectilinear modules with recessed balconies, and the upper stories exhibit a rigorous division with vertical mullions; however, the ground floor is entirely differentiated by uninterrupted transparent glazing, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a volumetric base with smooth, mullion-free glass. Ground floor glazing reveals warm interior lighting and maximum interior visibility, starkly contrasting the gridded pattern above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and there is a distinct visual transition at the base emphasizing base, grid, and massing contrast.
