A rectilinear building with five visible floors; ground floor appears approximately 1.5 times taller than each typical upper floor, emphasizing volumetric distinction. Façade consists of a rigorously gridded curtain wall system: each elevation is divided horizontally into 10 bays and vertically into 5 clear subdivisions per floor using slender mullions roughly 7 cm thick. Vertical mullions and horizontal spandrels are visible between all upper floors, with spandrels marking clear floor breaks. All upper floors maintain identical rhythm, module, and transparency, with no floor differentiated by material or glazing. Ground floor is treated separately: double-height, fully glazed with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and absolutely NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor panels, creating a distinct visual transition. Interior of ground floor is visible with warm lighting, underscoring permeability. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—this sharp contrast in architectural treatment at the base is essential.
