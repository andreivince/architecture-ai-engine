A rectilinear glass pavilion with a total of two visible floors sits on a broad, open plaza; the ground floor is visibly taller than the upper floor—estimated at around double height—clearly establishing a volumetric distinction. The façade consists of a curtain wall grid defined by slender, dark metal vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick and uninterrupted horizontal spandrels that create a modular rhythm; the ground floor features NO vertical mullions or divisions on its transparent glazing, resulting in uninterrupted glass panels at the base. Each elevation shows 6 horizontal bays and 2 vertical subdivisions per floor except at the ground level, where glazing appears as single, seamless panels per bay across the entire height. The transition between the base and upper floor is explicit, with the grid pattern sharply beginning above the smooth, mullion-free base glazing. No spandrels interrupt the ground floor glass, and interior volumes are visible, although no strong warm lighting is present. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, ensuring an explicit and distinct visual transition between base and upper levels.
