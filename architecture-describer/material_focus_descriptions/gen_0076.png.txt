A cubic massing structure with four visible floors, each offset in a staggered, interlocking form, the façade is composed of a uniform metal panel cladding grid with vertical and horizontal articulation; façade modules appear rectangular and consistently sized, divided by visible vertical mullions approximately 5 cm thick, creating a rhythm of three to five vertical bays per section horizontally and two to three vertical subdivisions per floor, with no discernible spandrels or explicit floor breaks between upper levels except through the shifting massing; window openings are irregularly distributed within the grid, varying in size, with no two consecutive floors aligning openings vertically, emphasizing a non-repetitive pattern. Ground floor stands clearly apart: it is single-height but visually taller than upper floors, with extensive, uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping corners—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, producing a smooth, clear envelope distinct from the upper panelized grid—accompanied by warm, glowing interior lighting and strong interior visibility, establishing clear volumetric and material distinction at the base. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, forming a distinct visual transition and emphasizing uninterrupted transparent glazing at base.
