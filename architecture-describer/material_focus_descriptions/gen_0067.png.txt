A single-story rectangular building with a steel-and-glass façade, the structure’s massing sits elevated on a light-colored, solid podium; the façade is defined by a clear rectilinear rhythm of vertical mullions (approximately 10 cm thick) and horizontal divisions, creating a precise grid with nine visible vertical bays on each exposed side and no subdivision between upper or lower sections since there is only one floor. The floor-to-ceiling glazed modules on all sides are uniform and uninterrupted by spandrels or floor breaks, except at the roof line where a thin, darker cap is visible. The ground floor is explicitly taller than a typical floor, with its height visually accentuated by the expansive, transparent glazing; there are NO vertical mullions or divisions interrupting the large glass panels at the base, resulting in uninterrupted transparent glazing at the building’s base and promoting a distinct visual transition from the structural podium to the upper transparent box. The interior is warmly lit and highly visible from the exterior, further enhancing the volumetric distinction of the ground level. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—this difference in glazing articulation and volumetric proportion is absolutely critical.
