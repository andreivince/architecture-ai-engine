A rectilinear modern building with three visible floors, each floor defined by a strict modular glass façade, the upper levels exhibiting 8 horizontal bays per dominant mass, each bay subdivided vertically into 3 grid sections per floor, with pronounced dark metal mullions approximately 10 cm thick, and clear horizontal spandrels or breaks between floors creating explicit rhythm; the massing steps at the edges, forming a series of offset rectangular volumes. The ground floor is unequivocally taller than the upper stories—double-height, approximately twice the height of a typical upper floor—and features uninterrupted transparent glazing across its entire base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on the ground floor glass, creating a continuous, seamless façade that contrasts clearly with the precisely gridded upper levels above. Warm interior lighting illuminates the ground floor and enhances high visibility of the interior, distinguishing the volumetric base from the rest of the building. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, enforcing a distinct visual transition between the base and the upper structured grid.
