A rectilinear glass office building with 5 visible floors, the base exhibiting a pronounced volumetric recession, with the ground floor distinctly taller—approximately double the height of upper floors—and visually separated by a strong horizontal spandrel line; ground floor façade features uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a smooth glass surface with clear interior visibility and warm lighting, emphasizing a volumetric and material distinction from the upper floors; upper levels utilize a rigorous glazed grid with 5 horizontal bays and 4 vertical subdivisions per bay on each floor, aluminum mullions approximately 6 cm thick running vertically and horizontally, creating a precise rectilinear rhythm, with visible spandrels marking each floor break; all upper floors identical in façade treatment, with no change in material or transparency except at the base; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and a distinct visual transition is mandatory between the transparent, column-free base and the gridded, mullion-intensive upper levels.
