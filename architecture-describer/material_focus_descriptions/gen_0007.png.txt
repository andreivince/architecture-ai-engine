A rectilinear building with a transparent façade, showing two visible floors with the ground floor distinctly double-height—approximately twice the height of the upper floor—with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a smooth volumetric distinction. The upper floor is organized in a strict vertical rhythm: 8 vertical bays per main elevation, each subdivided by slender vertical mullions approximately 5 cm thick, forming a precise modular grid pattern. No visible spandrels or pronounced floor breaks between modules, and floor-to-ceiling glazing dominates both levels. Warm interior lighting on the ground floor enhances interior visibility and emphasizes the open, airy volume, further distinguishing it from the upper grid pattern. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; there is a distinct visual transition at the base, and only the upper floor uses a regular module of vertical mullions.
