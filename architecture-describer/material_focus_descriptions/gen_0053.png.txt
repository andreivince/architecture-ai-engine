A rectilinear building mass with 2 visible floors above grade, the ground floor clearly taller than the upper level (ground floor height approximately double the upper floor), organized in a strict grid of vertical and horizontal modules. Façade features 6 horizontal bays across the long side, each subdivided by prominent vertical mullions spaced at regular intervals (~30 cm thickness), with intermediate horizontal divisions forming transparent glass modules of equal proportion on upper floors. Upper floor glazing is subdivided vertically and horizontally, each panel framed by visible mullions and, at floor line, by thin spandrels marking a pronounced grid rhythm; all upper modules are consistent in pattern and material, with no floor differing in materiality or transparency. The ground floor is fully glazed and highly transparent, with smooth, uninterrupted floor-to-ceiling glass panels, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, and interior visibly illuminated by warm lighting; volumetrically, the base reads as a distinct, taller plinth with maximum openness. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, enforcing a distinct visual transition between the transparent, double-height base and the regularized, mullioned façade above.
