A rectilinear modern building sits on a flat platform above water, displaying a total of 2 visible floors with a clear volumetric expression of repetitive modules; each main fa√ßade segment contains 6 horizontal bays and each bay is vertically subdivided into 3 tall glass panels per floor by dark mullions approximately 5 cm thick; mullions run floor to ceiling on upper floors, clearly defining a rigid grid without visible spandrels or horizontal floor breaks. The ground floor is explicitly taller, approximately double the height of the upper floor, demarcated by a distinct visual transition: the base features uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, contrasting sharply with the gridded upper floors. The internal lighting on the ground floor is warmly illuminated, emphasizing interior visibility and openness, and the ground floor massing is set back slightly above a light-colored solid plinth. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, ensuring the model generates a clear contrast between the continuous base glazing and the strict upper glass grid.
