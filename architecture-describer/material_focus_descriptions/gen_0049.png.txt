A rectilinear glass-and-metal building with three visible floors; the ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately 1.5x the height of the upper stories—and occupies the full building footprint. The façade on upper levels exhibits a strict, repetitive grid with 8 horizontal bays across the main façade, divided vertically into 3 floors, and each floor further separated by thin vertical mullions (approx. 7cm wide) and horizontal spandrels at every floor break, producing precise modular rhythm; glazing on upper floors is visually subdivided, with strong mullion presence and clear floor breaks. In contrast, the ground floor features completely uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping around the perimeter, NO vertical mullions or divisions on the ground floor glass, with warm interior lighting visible and maximum sightlines into the open, double-height volume. The massing is a simple box, but the visual transition between the transparent, smooth, tall ground floor base and the rigid upper floor grid is explicit: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, emphasizing a distinct volumetric and façade articulation at the base.
