A rectilinear building stands with 7 visible floors; the ground floor is clearly taller at approximately double the height of upper floors, providing a pronounced volumetric distinction. The façade showcases a rigorous grid pattern on upper levels: 5 horizontal bays per side, each vertically subdivided into 2 main glazed modules per floor, separated by metal mullions approximately 8 cm thick. Horizontal spandrels delineate each floor, giving a visibly stacked massing, and the rhythm of bays is uninterrupted throughout the height except at the base. Balconies are recessed irregularly but consistently on alternating sides. Critically, the ground floor features continuous, uninterrupted transparent glazing, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, enabling maximum interior visibility and warm lighting, in stark contrast to the tightly gridded, mullion-dense upper façade. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, forming an explicit, sharp visual transition at the base.
