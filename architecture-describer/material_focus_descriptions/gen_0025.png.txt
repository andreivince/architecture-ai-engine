A rectilinear glass building with three visible floors, the ground floor is notably taller—approximately double the height of the upper floors—and features uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a distinct visual transition and volumetric distinction from above; warm lighting and clear interior visibility characterize the ground floor, which serves as the primary entry façade module. The two upper floors are defined by a strict curtain wall grid: each floor is horizontally divided into seven bays, vertically subdivided by slender black mullions approximately 8 cm thick, and emphasizes a strong repetitive rhythm. Upper floors employ typical floor-to-ceiling glass modules with spandrel panels clearly present between floors, separating each level visually. There is no deviation in material or transparency between the upper two floors, but their massing steps slightly at building corners. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
