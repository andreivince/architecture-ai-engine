A cubic modernist building with a glazed façade, two visible floors total; the ground floor is notably taller, approximately double the height of the upper floor, firmly establishing volumetric distinction. The façade is organized into a strict rectilinear grid: each elevation displays 7 horizontal bays, subdivided vertically into two floor levels, and each vertical bay is separated by thin black mullions approximately 7 cm thick. Upper floors feature clear grid rhythm with consistent vertical mullions and rectangular opaque spandrels visually demarcating floors, no overhangs or projections; mullions are uninterrupted and divide the full façade with strict modularity. Ground floor: extensive transparent glazing wraps the entire base, with large glass panels uninterrupted by vertical mullions or divisions, creating smooth, planar glass—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing; glass panels at base are taller and distinct in scale from the upper module. Subtle interior lighting and interior elements are visible at the base, further emphasizing transparency. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, ensuring a distinct visual transition and strong contrast from the rigorously gridded and subdivided upper level.
