Rectilinear glass building with three distinct volumetric projections, four visible floors in total; the ground floor is clearly taller than the others, approximately double in height relative to upper stories. The façade forms a strict grid: each bay about 2 meters wide, with each floor above the ground subdivided by six vertical bays and three horizontal divisions per bay, delineated by dark mullions roughly 7–10 cm thick. The upper floors show a repetitive rhythm of vertical and horizontal mullions creating rectangular modules, with spandrels running between floors, while glazing dominates. Ground floor is volumetrically distinct, set back at some segments, and features uninterrupted transparent glazing with no vertical mullions or divisions—NO grid pattern, yielding a seamless glass base. This transparency contrasts the upper façade, enhancing interior visibility. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; there is a distinct visual transition between the seamless lower level and the orthogonal mullion grid above.
