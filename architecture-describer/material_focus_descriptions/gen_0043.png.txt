A rectilinear glass box with four visible floors, façade organized into a strict vertical and horizontal grid of glazed modules; the upper three floors feature a rigid pattern of 10 vertical bays (across the broad face) and 4 horizontal rows per façade, each bay subdivided by slim, dark mullions approximately 7 cm thick with clear spandrel breaks between the floors; the ground floor is distinctly double-height, reaching almost twice the regular floor height, and is explicitly articulated as a transparent, uninterrupted volumetric base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on the ground floor glazing, showcasing smooth glass panels and continuous warm interior lighting, creating full interior visibility and a dramatic volumetric separation from the upper grid; the upper levels repeat identical thin mullion spacing and rectangular modules, clearly separated from the ground level by a pronounced visual and material transition; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—force a distinct visual break at the base, uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, with the architectural rhythm of mullions and spandrels only present on the upper floors.
