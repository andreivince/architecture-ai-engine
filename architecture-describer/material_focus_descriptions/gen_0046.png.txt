A glass office building with 8 visible floors: the ground floor is clearly taller—double-height, approximately twice the height of upper floors, and forms a volumetric distinction from the rest. The façade is a rigid grid with 7 horizontal bays and 8 vertical subdivisions per primary elevation, resulting in a strong rhythm. On upper floors, thin metal mullions (approx. 5 cm wide) separate each glazing module vertically and horizontally, forming a precise curtain wall pattern; there are no spandrels or floor breaks, and all floors above the base are materially identical, except the ground floor. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, and transparent uninterrupted panels that expose a warmly lit and visible interior. The base and tower are separated by a distinct visual transition: uninterrupted transparent glazing at base sharply contrasts with the dense vertical and horizontal mullion grid above.
