A rectilinear glass-clad building with three visible floors, the façade organized in a strict grid: each elevation displaying seven horizontal bays subdivided vertically into six equally spaced modules per floor by black mullions approximately 8 cm thick. No visible spandrels or floor breaks; there is a seamless vertical rhythm with a consistent transparent glazing pattern on all upper floors. The ground floor is explicitly double-height—approximately twice the height of each upper floor—and visually distinct, featuring uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on the ground floor glass; continuous panels maximize transparency and expose warmly lit interior spaces with full volumetric visibility. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating a distinct visual transition where the base sharply contrasts the rigidly subdivided massing above.
