A rectilinear five-story building with clearly articulated massing steps, featuring a façade organized into a strict grid of horizontal and vertical modules; four main upper floors each subdivided into 6 horizontal bays per elevation, with each bay further divided vertically by approx. 8 visible mullions per floor, mullion thickness estimated at 8–10 cm; façade glazing is interrupted by both vertical mullions and horizontal spandrel bands on the upper floors, forming a regular rhythm, with some floors showing cantilevered modules that break the overall grid; all upper floors have identical façade treatment except the recessed top floor, which is set back and uses continuous glazed ribbon windows; ground floor is visually and volumetrically distinct: height is approximately 1.5 times that of upper floors, with NO vertical mullions or divisions, characterized by uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, and warm interior lighting with full interior visibility, creating a distinct visual transition from the gridded upper levels; ground floor modules are recessed with smooth, mullion-free glass and low solid plinths, emphasizing openness. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—base, grid, and massing distinctions must be explicit.
