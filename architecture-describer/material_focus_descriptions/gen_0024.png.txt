A rectilinear modernist building with a glass façade, exhibiting three visible floors plus a discernible double-height ground floor; the upper two floors are each standard height, while the ground level is clearly taller, approximately 1.5x the upper floor height. The façade is divided into a strict grid of vertical and horizontal modules: each main elevation shows 7 horizontal bays and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, defined by dark metal mullions approximately 8 cm in thickness. All upper floors feature regular vertical and horizontal mullions intersecting to form clear rectangular glazing panels, with spandrels visible between floors; grid rhythm is consistent across massing volumes. The ground floor is visually distinct: no visible vertical mullions or divisions within each individual glass panel, presenting continuous, uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, with warm interior lighting creating strong visual separation and volumetric distinction from the upper grid. The massing is composed of interlocking glass boxes, and the façade transitions abruptly at the base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, only smooth, mullion-free glass. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, a distinct visual transition from the upper stories’ rigid grid and mullion pattern.
