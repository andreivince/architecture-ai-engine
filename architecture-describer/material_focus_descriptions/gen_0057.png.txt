A rectilinear building with six visible floors features a pronounced visual hierarchy: the ground floor is clad in smooth concrete panels and horizontal strip windows, unequivocally distinct from the transparent glass grid above. The ground floor height is roughly 1.5 times that of each upper floor, and its glazing is defined by large, uninterrupted horizontal panels—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—ensuring a clear volumetric and visual base; ground floor lighting and interior detail are not discernible. Above, five uniform floors form a strict grid façade composed of six horizontal bays and three vertical subdivisions per bay on each elevation, delineated by slender, 8–10 cm thick metallic mullions, creating a sharp rhythm. These upper floors exhibit regular spandrels marking floor breaks, and their glass panels maintain consistent dimensions with a uniform module. The transition between the opaque, mullion-free ground floor and the gridded transparent upper massing is abrupt and architecturally explicit: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, ensuring a distinct visual transition between base and tower.
