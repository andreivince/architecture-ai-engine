A rectilinear office building with 8 visible floors, the ground floor clearly taller—approximately double the height of each upper level—with seven horizontal bays and ten vertical subdivisions per façade, each grid section separated by slender, approximately 6 cm thick vertical mullions and thinner horizontal transoms; the upper floors exhibit a strict, repetitive curtain wall grid pattern with continuous vertical mullions, clear spandrel elements aligned with slabs, and uniform glazing rhythm, with no visible difference in material or transparency between upper levels. The ground floor is volumetrically distinct, double-height, set apart by uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base: NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, emphasizing a seamless façade and maximum interior visibility, with warm lighting visible inside and a strong contrast to the tight grid above. The façade must show a distinct visual transition at first floor slab: The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
