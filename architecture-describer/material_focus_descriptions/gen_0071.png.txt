A rectilinear pavilion with two visible floors, where the ground floor is explicitly taller (approximately double the height of the upper floor), and the upper floor façade presents a strict vertical grid of evenly spaced glazed modules; each elevation features 8–10 continuous vertical bays subdivided by thin vertical mullions (estimated 6–8 cm thick) and horizontal transoms of matching profile, forming a rhythmic curtain wall grid, with all upper-floor glazing vertically subdivided, and no visible spandrels or pronounced floor slab breaks interrupting the glass. The ground floor is defined by uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—creating a smooth, clear volumetric base highly distinct from the upper grid pattern, with interior spaces fully visible and warmly lit, emphasizing a distinct visual transition and volumetric distinction between base and upper stories. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. Massing is simple with rectilinear extrusions; the building sits on a low plinth of horizontal precast concrete panels, further accentuating the separation between the mullion-free base and the gridded, vertically articulated upper façade.
