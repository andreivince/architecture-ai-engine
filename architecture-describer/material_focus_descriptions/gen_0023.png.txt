A rectangular building with a flat roof and three visible floors, each floor defined by a strict vertical rhythm of evenly spaced, thin black mullions approximately 8 cm thick; the façade features continuous floor-to-ceiling glazing panels on the upper two floors, each level subdivided into 8 horizontal bays and 3 vertical modules per bay, with no apparent spandrels or horizontal breaks between slabs—vertical mullions only, creating a rigid grid pattern. The ground floor is visually distinct and taller than the upper floors, measuring nearly double in height, and it features uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—complete smooth glass panels wrapping the entire base, providing warm interior lighting and clear views inside, in stark contrast to the upper grid. The transition between ground and upper floors is explicit, with the ground floor appearing volumetrically set apart, offering a distinct visual separation and transparency. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; emphasize uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and a distinct visual transition between base and upper floors.
