A rectilinear glass building with a strictly modular façade of four visible floors, with the ground floor clearly taller than the others (approximately double height), each upper floor of regular height; façade divided into a rigid grid of vertical mullions and horizontal transoms, with each floor presenting 7 horizontal bays and each bay vertically subdivided into 3 sections per floor above ground; mullions are dark-colored and consistently slim, approximately 6 cm thick; no visible spandrels or floor breaks between upper stories, creating an uninterrupted vertical rhythm; the ground floor is visually distinct and volumetrically prominent, employing larger uninterrupted glass panels, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, resulting in uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and a distinct visual transition from the upper grid pattern; the upper floors feature a tight orthogonal grid, while the ground floor’s transparency and absence of visible divisions distinguish its appearance and volumetric presence—the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
