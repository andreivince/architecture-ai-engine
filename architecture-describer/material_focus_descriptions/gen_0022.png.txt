A rectilinear building with strict orthogonal massing, the façade displays a total of two visible floors, with the ground floor clearly double-height and approximately twice the height of the upper floor; the façade is subdivided into a rigorous grid of vertical and horizontal modules, averaging five vertical bays across each primary elevation and each vertical bay further divided into three to four horizontal panes per floor, defined by dark metal mullions around 6-8 cm thick. The upper floor consists of gridded glass panels with clear vertical and horizontal mullions and opaque spandrels between modules, while the ground floor is entirely clad in uninterrupted transparent glazing, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, producing a distinct visual transition and volumetric separation from the upper level’s regularized grid rhythm. Warm interior lighting makes the ground floor highly transparent and visually accessible, and no spandrels are visible at the base, maximizing openness. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; this explicit contrast between the expansive transparent base and the tightly gridded, partially opaque upper façade is critical for accurate recreation.
