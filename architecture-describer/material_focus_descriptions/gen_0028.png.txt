A rectilinear building with five visible floors, each floor expressed as a modular grid with a geometric, stacked massing and pronounced horizontal and vertical rhythm on the façade; upper floors utilize a stringent arrangement of horizontal bands and vertical mullions approximately 10-12 cm thick, subdividing each elevation into 4 to 5 horizontal bays and 3 to 4 vertical modules per floor, with spandrel panels clearly separating each level. The façade is clad in light-colored panels, with windows irregularly distributed but always constrained within the grid’s module, showing no continuous curtain wall system. The ground floor is clearly taller—approximately double the height of upper levels—and is distinguished by smooth, uninterrupted transparent glazing running along the base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a distinct visual and volumetric transition; interior visibility is maximized at this base, highlighted by warm lighting. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, ensuring an explicit and dramatic contrast between the transparent, open base and the segmented, modular upper façade.
