A rectilinear building with five visible floors, the façade composed of a precise vertical and horizontal grid: each floor has six horizontal bays across and five vertical subdivisions per bay, resulting in a highly regular grid pattern with visible mullions approximately 8 cm thick; mullions and spandrels form a continuous rhythm across all upper floors, with no apparent floor breaks and consistent materiality in metal and glass. The massing is defined by boxy projections breaking the planar grid yet keeping the modular pattern. Windows are deeply inset and distributed irregularly across floors, interrupting the otherwise strict grid, and there are no visible changes in material or height among the upper floors except for these projections and recesses. The ground floor is distinctly different: it is single-height but visually taller than upper levels, featuring uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on the ground floor glazing, offering clear sightlines into a warmly lit interior — resulting in a pronounced volumetric and visual distinction from the grid above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern and a clear, distinct visual transition between base and upper modules.
