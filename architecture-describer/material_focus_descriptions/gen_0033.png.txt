A rectilinear modern building with 6 visible floors, the façade composed of a strict grid of projecting rectangular modules forming an alternating rhythm, each floor offset horizontally for a dynamic massing. The upper five floors have a uniform height, while the ground floor is clearly taller—approximately 1.5 times the height of the others—and distinguished by its fully transparent, uninterrupted glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions. The ground floor appears double-height, with warm interior lighting and clear volumetric distinction, offering high visibility into the interior; this base is visually separated from the upper structure by a distinct visual transition. The façade above the base presents 5 horizontal bays per side per floor, each subdivided vertically into two to three units by slim mullions (~8 cm thick), with opaque spandrels marking floor breaks. No floor other than the ground floor is visually distinguished by material or transparency; all upper levels continue the regular grid pattern, interrupted by the projecting modular blocks, providing varied semi-open terraces. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. Vertical mullions are clearly present in the upper levels’ module grid but fully absent from the ground floor, creating a dramatic base-grid contrast that must be explicit in the rendering.
