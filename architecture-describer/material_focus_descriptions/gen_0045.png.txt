A rectilinear tower with a total of 7 visible floors, the ground floor distinctly taller—approximately double the floor height of upper levels—clearly articulated with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, producing uninterrupted transparent glazing at base; warm lighting and full visibility into the interior emphasize the volumetric and material distinction of the ground floor, which forms a strong visual break from the upper façade. The upper six floors are organized in a regular grid of three horizontal bays and three vertical subdivisions per face, featuring a strict rhythm of vertical and horizontal mullions approximately 10 cm thick. The façade incorporates continuous glazing modules on upper levels, with each floor separated by narrow spandrel zones, and balconies projecting out of select corner modules without altering the underlying grid. A flat roof cap articulates the tower’s massing. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, explicitly marking a distinct visual transition between the transparent base and the repetitive, gridded curtain wall above.
