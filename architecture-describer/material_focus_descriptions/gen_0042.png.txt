A cuboid, modular building with 7 clearly visible floors, each receded and projected in an irregular stacked massing; the façade is composed of a strict grid of rectangular glass modules, each floor divided into approximately 8 horizontal bays and 5 vertical subdivisions per visible elevation, with black mullions approximately 7 cm thick framing each glass panel; the ground floor is volumetrically distinct and visually separated by a pronounced step-back and base articulation, with double-height glazing (ground floor height roughly twice that of upper floors), warm interior lighting, and completely uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glass, creating a smooth, continuous surface that maximizes transparency and allows clear visual access inside; above, all upper floors exhibit a regular rhythm of vertical and horizontal mullions defining the grid, with visible spandrels between floors; there is an explicit, sharp transition between the base and upper stories in both pattern and transparency; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, emphasizing the distinct visual transition between the open, transparent base and the tightly gridded, modular upper façades.
