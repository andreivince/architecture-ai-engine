A rectilinear building with visible massing as stacked rectilinear volumes, comprising 7 floors total; the ground floor is explicitly taller than the upper levels, roughly double their height, and demonstrates a distinct visual transition with uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping the base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a smooth, volumetric distinction and clear views of warm interior lighting. Above, the upper 6 floors feature a rigorously regular grid of glass modules with darker vertical and horizontal mullions, each floor subdivided into 5 horizontal bays and 4 vertical divisions per bay; mullion thickness is consistently 3–4 cm, giving sharp articulation to each façade segment. No spandrels or horizontal floor breaks interrupt the grid, modules span full-height per division, except for loggia or balcony cutouts recessed at irregular intervals. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the sharply gridded upper pattern—this contrast and breakpoint is mandatory, emphasizing an uninterrupted transparent glazing at base against the disciplined vertical and horizontal rhythm above.
