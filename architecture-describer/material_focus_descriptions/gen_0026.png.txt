A rectilinear glass building with three visible floors and a volumetric massing composed of interlocking rectangular modules; façade articulated by a precise grid of vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick and horizontal spandrels that subdivide each floor into seven evenly spaced vertical bays, with each upper floor divided by distinct mullions and slim horizontal joints creating a strict orthogonal rhythm; the ground floor is clearly taller than the others, forming a double-height base with utterly uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glass, producing a smooth, monolithic volume that visually contrasts the articulated grid above; no horizontal spandrel lines disrupt the ground level, and interior spaces are warmly illuminated and visibly open; upper floors employ regular, narrow mullions and visible floor breaks with smaller glazing panels; very explicit contrast: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass distinctly different from the upper grid pattern, establishing a pronounced visual transition between the transparent base and subdivided upper façade.
