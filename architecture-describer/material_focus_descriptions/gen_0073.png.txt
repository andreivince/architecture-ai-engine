Rectilinear modern building showing six visible floors, with the ground floor explicitly double-height—its estimated height is roughly twice that of each upper floor. The façade above the base is articulated into a precise structural grid: each upper floor divided into six horizontal bays and five clear vertical subdivisions per bay, separated by slim vertical mullions approximately 5 cm thick and prominent horizontal spandrels marking each floor slab. The upper floors have consistent glazing modules, giving a strict repetitive rhythm, and all upper floors use the same translucent materials and overall transparency, with no floor standing out in materiality or height. In distinct contrast, the ground floor is wholly wrapped in larger uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, resulting in an expansive volumetric distinction and offering clear interior visibility accentuated by warm lighting. There is a clear visual transition between the mullion-free, smooth glass base and the regular gridded pattern above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; vertical mullions are visible on all upper floors but entirely absent from the ground floor glazing.
