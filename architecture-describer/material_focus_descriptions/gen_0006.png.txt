A rectilinear, glass-façaded building with four visible floors, where the ground floor is clearly double-height—substantially taller than the three identical upper floors, approximately twice their height; façade displays a strict grid of vertical and horizontal modules with nine vertical bays and five horizontal divisions per façade, each bay separated by slender mullions approximately 7 cm thick; upper floors utilize vertical mullions and horizontal spandrels to create a regular, orthogonal rhythm, with no decorative relief or material transitions between upper levels; there are no spandrel panels—each horizontal band is fully glazed; crucially, the ground floor features uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, establishing a distinct visual transition between the base and the repetitive, gridded upper massing; interior lighting on the ground floor projects warm illumination and clear visibility into the spacious volume; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, making the volumetric and façade treatment contrast explicit and legible.
