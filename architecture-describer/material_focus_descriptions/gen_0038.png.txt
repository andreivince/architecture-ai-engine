A rectilinear building with six visible floors, the ground floor visibly taller than the upper levels (ground floor estimated at double the average height of upper floors), utilizing uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with absolutely NO vertical mullions or divisions; ground floor façade panels are smooth and large, creating a volumetric distinction with warm interior lighting and full interior visibility, forming a distinct visual transition from the upper stories. Each upper floor comprises a rigid grid of curtain wall modules, arranged in four horizontal bays across each façade side, with visible vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick and horizontal spandrels between floors; all upper levels are uniform in height, material, and transparency, utilizing a repeated cladding pattern with no floor clearly different from others. The upper façade’s grid has clear rhythmic mullions and spandrels, with each floor subdivided vertically into four bays and horizontally into two to three subdivisions, except for the base. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—explicitly: vertical mullions are only present above the ground floor, which is characterized by large uninterrupted glass panels and a distinct volumetric separation from the massed, gridded upper façade.
