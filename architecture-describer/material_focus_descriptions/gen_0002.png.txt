A rectilinear building massing with a strictly orthogonal glass façade; three visible above-ground floors are present, with the ground floor clearly double-height and approximately twice the height of the upper levels. The façade above the ground floor is organized into a precise grid with 7 horizontal bays and 3 vertical floors, each separated by thin vertical mullions estimated at 5–7 cm and horizontal spandrels with slight emphasis—consistent, repetitive rhythm across the upper stories. The upper two floors feature a repetitive grid of transparent glazing, divided by the thin mullions into narrow vertical modules; each vertical bay appears identical with no subdivision change, while projecting balcony modules on the sides break the otherwise flush façade only at the sides. The ground floor is volumetrically distinct, visually set apart by uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—maximizing interior visibility with warm lighting and no visible spandrels, setting a clear visual and material transition from the strictly gridded, mullion-dominated upper façade. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, emphasizing the distinct volumetric and fenestration hierarchy critical to faithfully regenerate this structure.
