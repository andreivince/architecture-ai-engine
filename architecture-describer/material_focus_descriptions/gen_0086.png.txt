A rectilinear building with 9 visible floors, where the ground floor is distinctly taller (approximately double the height of upper floors), uses large uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, providing clear volumetric distinction and strong interior visibility with prominent warm lighting; the ground floor façade modules are organized with horizontal bays of uninterrupted glass, broken only by returns at the corners, emphasizing a distinct transition from the upper structure. Upper floors utilize a strict rectilinear façade grid composed of alternating glass panel modules in a regular rhythm, typically 4 to 5 horizontal bays per segment and 2 to 3 vertical subdivisions per floor, with aluminum mullions approximately 6 cm thick, no spandrels are visible; upper massing is highly irregular and cubic, featuring substantial horizontal and vertical recesses and projections that disrupt the rhythm. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; a distinct visual transition at the base is essential, as upper floors use visibly gridded modules and vertical mullions not present at the ground level.
