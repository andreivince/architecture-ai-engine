Rectilinear glass building with five visible floors, where the ground floor is visibly taller than the four upper floors—ground floor estimated at roughly double the height of upper stories; façade defined by a strict grid with clear vertical and horizontal aluminum mullions, each approximately 7–10 cm thick; each primary elevation of the upper façade organized into 6 horizontal bays and 5 vertical subdivisions per floor for a strongly rhythmic module, with all upper floors identical in height, mullion pattern, and transparency; no visible spandrels or intermediary floor breaks between levels—glass curtain wall grid is unbroken in rhythm from second to fifth floors; the ground floor is a volumetric base with a distinct visual transition: continuous, uninterrupted transparent glazing along the base with NO vertical mullions or divisions present, permitting clear views into warmly lit interior spaces and sharply contrasting upper floor grid, marking the ground floor as entirely distinct through its smooth, mullion-free glass; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—this base/grid differentiation is visually explicit and fundamental to the massing and architectural articulation.
