A rectilinear building massing composed of four visible floors, with the ground floor clearly taller than upper levels (ground floor approximately twice the height of other floors), features an explicit visual distinction at its base: the ground floor comprises uninterrupted transparent glazing without any vertical mullions or divisions, providing full-height, clear glass panes with smooth surfaces, warm interior lighting, and volumetric separation from the floors above. Upper three floors exhibit a rigid curtain wall grid with prominent vertical mullions (approximately 5-7 cm thick) and less pronounced horizontal divisions, forming a regular module rhythm; each upper floor is subdivided into 8-9 horizontal bays across the façade, each bay further segmented vertically, while spandrels are present as opaque bands separating vision glazing. Several upper floors include recessed terrace-like areas enclosed with glass but set back from the primary façade plane. Mullions on upper floors are clearly visible and regular, while the ground floor façade is entirely mullion-free. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. The model must treat the base’s uninterrupted transparent glazing and warm-lit, open volume separately from the upper structure, which is governed by a strict vertical mullion rhythm and horizontal spandrel breaks.
