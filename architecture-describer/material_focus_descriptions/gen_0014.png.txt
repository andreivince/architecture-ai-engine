A rectilinear glass building with four visible floors: the ground floor is double-height, approximately twice the vertical dimension of the upper floors, and features uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—creating a smooth base with clear volumetric distinction; warm interior lighting and full interior visibility are present, reinforcing its openness. Above, three upper floors each use a strict structural grid of clear glass panels framed by vertical mullions approximately 7–10 cm thick, organized into five horizontal bays per façade with four vertical subdivisions per floor, producing a rhythmic and modular façade pattern. There are no visible spandrels or opaque floor breaks between floors—horizontal divisions are solely by the mullion grid. The ground floor MUST appear significantly taller than upper levels, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the pronounced grid and mullion pattern above, creating an explicit, distinct visual transition and hierarchy between the transparent, open base and the rational gridded upper façades.
