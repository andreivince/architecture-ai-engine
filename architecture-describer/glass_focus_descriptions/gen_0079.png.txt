A rectilinear building massing with a strict orthogonal grid dominates the façade, consisting of four visible floors; the ground floor is clearly taller, estimated at approximately twice the height of upper floors, which are uniform. Each elevation is subdivided horizontally into roughly 7 bays, and vertically on each floor by thin vertical mullions at regular intervals, with mullion thickness estimated at 4 cm, creating a precise, repetitive rhythm. The upper floors have full glazing with prominent vertical mullions and subtle horizontal divisions at slab levels; no pronounced spandrels are visible, resulting in a continuous vertical façade grid. The ground floor is volumetrically distinct and set back in places; it utilizes uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—panels span entire bays, establishing a strong visual base and a marked contrast with the upper levels' subdivided grid. Warm interior lighting and interior visibility are evident at the base, enhancing openness. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, forming a distinct visual transition and making the division explicit between the glossy, tall, uninterrupted glazing at the base and the aligned, mullion-defined rhythm above.
