A rectilinear three-story building with visible massing steps; each floor is articulated with a consistent vertical façade grid. There are three above-ground floors: the ground floor is visibly taller (tallest floor), while the upper two are of equal, more standard commercial height. The façade’s glazing system on upper floors is divided into 7 horizontal bays with each bay further subdivided by narrow vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick, creating regular vertical and horizontal rhythm and clear modules; prominent narrow spandrels accentuate floor breaks. On the ground floor, there is a distinct visual transition with uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on the ground floor glazing—yielding total façade smoothness, clear volumetric distinction, and warm interior lighting evident in the visible interior, with interior space and activity clearly visible. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. This contrast between the upper façade grid pattern—with thin, repeated vertical mullions and spandrels—and the mullion-free, transparent ground floor is explicit and essential to the form’s architectural identity.
