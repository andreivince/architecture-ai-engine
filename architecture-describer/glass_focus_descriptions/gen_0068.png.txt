Rectilinear building massing with three visible floors above a water plinth, each floor exhibiting a clear stacked box geometry; upper façade features a rigid rhythmic grid of tall, vertically oriented glazing modules divided by narrow black aluminum mullions (approximately 6 cm thick) with spacing creating a uniform vertical emphasis, each bay measuring around 3 meters wide, with at least 7 horizontal bays per major visible segment and two vertical subdivisions per floor per bay; floors two and three have identical transparency and glazing rhythm, with slight horizontal floor breaks visible as thin spandrels between glass bands; no materials or modulations distinguish the upper floor modules. The ground floor is explicitly taller—double-height—and enveloped in uninterrupted transparent glazing, with NO vertical mullions or divisions interrupting the ground floor façade, unlike the upper grid pattern; strong warm interior lighting and clear interior visibility enhance volumetric distinction; the base is volumetrically set apart, forming a distinct visual transition from the upper stories, situated above a crisp, rectilinear podium set directly in water. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—this base uses uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, creating a striking contrast with the rigidly divided façade above.
