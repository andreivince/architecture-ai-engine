A rectilinear building with five visible floors, each upper floor (2–5) displaying a strict vertical façade rhythm with continuous metal cladding panels divided by mullions approximately 10 cm thick; no horizontal spandrels are evident, resulting in a seamless floor stack with minor variance in massing emphasized by projecting and recessed modules, especially at the corners and select central bays. The upper façade is subdivided into roughly six horizontal bays per main elevation, each floor consistently in height except for the ground level, which is clearly double-height and visually distinguished. The ground floor portion features uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a smooth, expansive look entirely different from the upper grid pattern, with warm interior lighting and clear volumetric distinction; interior spaces and furniture are visible from outside. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, ensuring a distinct visual transition and strong architectural hierarchy between the transparent, inviting base and the rigorously gridded upper stories.
