A rectilinear glass office building with three visible floors, the upper two floors are uniform in height while the ground floor is clearly taller, appearing nearly double the height of those above it; façade is a transparent curtain wall system with a strict regular grid of vertical mullions approximately 8–10 cm thick and horizontal transoms, subdividing each floor into 10 horizontal bays and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay, forming a visually dominant rhythm; no opaque spandrels—floor breaks are only demarcated by the grid pattern; the ground floor features entirely uninterrupted transparent glazing without any vertical mullions or divisions, creating a smooth, open effect; warm interior lighting and visible spaces inside create a volumetric distinction and clear visual transition between the base and upper grid; upper floors maintain a regular mullion grid, but the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—explicitly state uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and distinct visual transition from the mullioned grid above.
