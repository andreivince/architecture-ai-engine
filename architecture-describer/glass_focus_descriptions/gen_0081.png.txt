A rectilinear building with 5 visible floors, characterized by a distinctive grid pattern façade composed of metallic cladding panels and irregular protruding modules that break the planar massing, each upper floor (2nd to 5th) approximately equal in height, while the ground floor is marginally taller, creating a subtle volumetric distinction at the base. The façade rhythm on upper levels comprises roughly 4–5 horizontal bays across each visible face, with vertical subdivisions in the form of recessed glazing and articulated mullions, estimated at 8–10 cm thick, between glazed and opaque panels; clear horizontal spandrels, formed by extended balcony bands, sharply demarcate each floor. The glazing on the upper floors is interrupted by vertical mullions and is set back within balcony modules, while fenestration varies in width within the grid, producing an asymmetric yet rhythmic window arrangement. The ground floor, described separately, presents larger glass panels with minimal framing, creating a sense of transparency and permeability—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—and warm interior lighting is visible, further enhancing the sense of openness and rendering a clear visual transition from the denser upper grid. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass distinct from the upper grid pattern; this base, with uninterrupted transparent glazing, explicitly contrasts the articulated modular façade and mullioned upper levels.
