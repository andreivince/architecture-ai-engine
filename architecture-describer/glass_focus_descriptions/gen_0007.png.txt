Rectangular glass pavilion with two visible floors; total height of ground floor is approximately double that of the upper floor (ground floor is explicitly double-height), with the ground floor at about 6 meters and the upper floor at 3 meters. The fa√ßade is strictly gridded: each elevation shows 12 horizontal bays, with each bay subdivided vertically by slender metal mullions approximately 5 cm thick. Upper floor has clearly visible vertical mullions and consistent vertical rhythm; there are no horizontal spandrels, and mullions run continuously from top to bottom of the upper floor. Distinct visual transition at the ground floor: the base features uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, forming a seamless band of smooth glass panels. Warm lighting and clear interior visibility at the base, emphasizing volumetric distinction, with visible furnishings and open space. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; make the contrast explicit between the double-height, uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and the regular vertical mullion grid of the upper floor.
