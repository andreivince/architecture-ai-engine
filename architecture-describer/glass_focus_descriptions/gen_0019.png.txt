A rectilinear building with six visible floors; the ground floor is taller than the upper floors, measuring approximately double the upper floor height. The façade is defined by a strict modular grid of vertical and horizontal metal mullions, each approximately 8 cm thick, forming both horizontal bays and vertical subdivisions, with each floor comprising roughly six horizontal bays and five vertical subdivisions per bay. Upper floors display a regular grid of mullions with visible spandrels separating each floor, interrupted by staggered volumetric extrusions and recesses. Glazing throughout the upper stories is divided by these thin mullions, creating a clear rhythm of transparent and opaque panels. Critically, the ground floor is a double-height volume with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, providing maximum visibility into a warmly-lit interior; the smooth, mullion-free glass of the ground floor sharply contrasts with the rigid grid above, establishing a distinct visual transition and clear volumetric distinction at the base. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—make this contrast explicit and ensure the façade hierarchy is visually unmistakable.
