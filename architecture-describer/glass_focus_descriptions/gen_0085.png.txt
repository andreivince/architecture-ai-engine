A rectilinear building with five visible floors, each articulated as stacked volumes offset in plan, exhibiting a strict glass and metal façade; the ground floor is distinctly taller, approximately double the height of upper floors, and is wrapped in continuous, uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, immediately distinguishing it from the upper levels with a clear visual and volumetric transition—this base must appear smooth and mullion-free, unlike the regular gridded upper floors. Above, each typical floor contains a repetitive façade rhythm subdivided into eleven horizontal bays, each bay with five vertical subdivisions defined by slender metal mullions approximately 5 cm thick; there are no spandrels or horizontal floor-breaks expressed externally, and all upper levels show consistent glazing with visible mullions creating a strong rectilinear module. No floor is visually differentiated by material or transparency except for the ground floor as described. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; emphasize the clear contrast between the uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base and the rigorously gridded upper façades.
