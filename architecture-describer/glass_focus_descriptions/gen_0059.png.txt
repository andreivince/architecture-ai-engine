A rectilinear modern structure with four visible floors, the ground floor distinctly taller—approximately twice the height of the upper floors—emphasizing volumetric distinction; façade articulated by a rigorous grid of vertical and horizontal slender mullions, estimated at roughly 6 cm thickness, organizing the upper three floors into regular bays approximately 1.2 meters wide, with each floor displaying six horizontal bays and four vertical subdivisions per bay, all separated by thin horizontal spandrels. The upper floors show continuous glazing divided by these mullions creating a strict rhythm, while massing includes pronounced rectilinear projections offset irregularly, contributing to a dynamic volumetric effect. Importantly, the ground floor is composed of uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions, enabling clear views into a brightly lit interior, resulting in a distinct visual transition from the upper grid pattern—this base level MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass, absolutely different from upper floors’ segmented module façade and fine grid rhythm.
