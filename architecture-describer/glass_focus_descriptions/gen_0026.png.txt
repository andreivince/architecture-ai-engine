A rectangular modern building with a flat roof and five visible floors, the façade exhibits a strict vertical rhythm composed of 16 evenly spaced bays per main face, each bay subdivided by slender vertical mullions approximately 6 cm thick; horizontal divisions between floors are extremely minimal, with no evident spandrels or pronounced floor breaks, resulting in near-continuous glazing vertically from the second to fifth floors. The ground floor is clearly taller than all upper levels—double-height and visually distinct—using expansive uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, creating smooth glass panels that reveal warm lighting and a highly visible interior, thus establishing a clear volumetric and material transition. The upper floors maintain a uniform module grid with pronounced mullions and a golden reflective tint, while the ground floor’s seamless glass contrasts this grid rigorously. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; the model must render a distinct visual transition at the base with uninterrupted transparent glazing at the ground level and a strict vertical mullion grid on all upper stories.
