A rectilinear glass office building façade with five visible floors, where the ground floor is clearly taller than the upper floors (ground floor estimated at 1.7 times the height of other floors), exhibiting a distinct massing with stepped upper volumes. The façade is subdivided into six horizontal bays per main elevation, each bay containing five vertical subdivisions per floor, defined by thin vertical mullions approximately 5-7 cm wide and horizontal floor line transoms of similar thickness; consistent vertical rhythm, no visible spandrels but clear glazed floor breaks. The ground floor is volumetrically distinct, double-height, and features uninterrupted transparent glazing at base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—contrasting sharply with the tight mullion grid above; interior warmly illuminated with visible wood finishes and full-height open views, underscoring a distinct visual transition between base and grid. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; all upper stories repeat precise grid module with vertical and horizontal mullions, while the base is uninterrupted and transparent.
