A seven-story modern glass building with a strictly orthogonal façade: façade divided into a grid of six horizontal bays and five vertical subdivisions per typical floor, with each bay containing uniform, clear glazing modules separated by pronounced vertical and horizontal mullions approximately 6–8 cm thick, forming a regular rhythmic pattern; upper floors feature inset balconies puncturing the grid, breaking the smooth massing on select corners and mid-bays; no spandrel panels—glazing runs floor-to-floor, with clear demarcation between each story via strong mullion breaks; all floors above the base have identical height except the ground floor, which is a distinct, double-height volume; the ground floor is entirely glazed with uninterrupted transparent glass panels, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a smooth façade and a clear visual base with maximal interior visibility, warm interior lighting, and a volumetric distinction from the upper grid—making the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and establishing a distinct visual transition between the transparent base and the mullioned upper structure.
