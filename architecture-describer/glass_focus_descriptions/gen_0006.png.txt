A rectilinear two-story building with a glass façade, showing a total of two visible floors; the ground floor has a double-height volumetric distinction, clearly taller than the upper floor (ground approximately twice the height of the upper floor), and is fully transparent with NO vertical mullions or divisions—uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, providing seamless views into warmly lit, highly visible interiors; clear distinct visual transition between the continuous ground floor base and the gridded pattern above. The upper floor features a strong, regular grid: each main elevation is subdivided into approximately eight horizontal bays, each bay framed by vertical mullions approximately 6–8 cm thick, and each floor further subdivided vertically by horizontal elements at floor and ceiling lines—spandrels are absent, with full-height glazing within the dense mullion grid. No material change is visible between upper modules, but the rhythm and proportion shifts dramatically between the base and upper floor. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
