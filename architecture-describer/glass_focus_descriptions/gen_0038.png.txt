A rectilinear building with five visible floors, each expressed as a cantilevered module in a staggered massing, features a distinct visual transition between the ground floor and upper floors; the ground floor is approximately double-height and fully glazed with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, showcasing NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, maximizing interior visibility and warm lighting, and presenting the ground floor as volumetrically separate and taller from the upper grid pattern. The façade of the upper four floors is organized into a strict rectangular panel system, with each floor divided by thin vertical and horizontal mullions (estimated thickness 4 cm), producing a consistent grid without spandrels and with visible floor breaks; each upper floor contains a regular rhythm of 4–5 horizontal bays per elevation, with continuous horizontal bands of metal cladding alternating with strip windows of clear glazing, though some bays are recessed to create depth. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, ensuring a clear architectural hierarchy and a pronounced distinction between the transparent base and the regimented, modular upper massing.
