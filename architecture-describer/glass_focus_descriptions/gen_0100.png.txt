A mid-rise modernist building with 7 visible floors, the fa√ßade composed entirely of rectilinear glass curtain wall modules, each floor divided horizontally into 5 bays and vertically by thin mullions approximately 5 cm thick. The massing features pronounced extrusions and recesses, creating a staggered rhythm along the elevation. No spandrels or overt floor breaks are present, producing a continuous vertical grid above the base. The ground floor is distinctly taller than upper floors (double-height, roughly twice as high), with uninterrupted transparent glazing: NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating total visual openness at the base and revealing interior spaces warmly lit, contrasting volumetrically and in transparency from the upper repetitive grid. The distinct visual transition: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. Vertical mullions are visible only on upper floors, absent at the base, emphasizing the differentiated architectural treatment of ground and upper floors.
