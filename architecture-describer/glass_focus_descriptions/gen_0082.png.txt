A rectilinear building with a five-floor massing, where the ground floor is visibly taller—approximately double the height of upper floors—with a clear volumetric distinction at the base; the ground floor façade features uninterrupted transparent glazing on all sides, completely devoid of vertical mullions or divisions, producing a smooth glass curtain appearance with warm interior lighting and full visibility into the interior, establishing a distinct visual transition from the grid above. Upper floors each have a uniform height and are organized by a strict grid of vertical and horizontal mullions, forming a regular rhythm of approximately five horizontal bays per major façade and eight vertical subdivisions per bay on each floor, with visible vertical mullions averaging 7-10 cm in thickness and thin horizontal spandrel panels marking each floor break. The façade grid above the ground level features sections of projecting volumes, maintaining the same grid pattern with transparent and semi-reflective glazing; no floor above the ground floor shows a material or transparency shift except for increased solid spandrel content at floor breaks. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free, uninterrupted transparent glazing different from the upper rigid grid pattern, and this distinction between base and upper floors is visually explicit through materials, transparency, and façade module organization.
