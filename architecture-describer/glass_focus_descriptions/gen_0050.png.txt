A cubic building with five visible floors; ground floor is clearly taller than the others, estimated at approximately double height, creating a pronounced volumetric base. The façade is organized into a precise grid: on each face, there are nine horizontal bays and five vertical subdivisions per floor, except at the ground floor which uses smooth, uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping the entire base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing. Upper floors feature a rigorous curtain wall system with vertical mullions spaced about 120 cm apart and thin horizontal spandrels between floors, each mullion approximately 7–10 cm thick; this creates a strong modular rhythm not present at the ground floor. There is a distinct visual transition between the ground and upper levels: the ground floor must appear taller, with clear, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; lighting on the base is warm, with interior spaces and circulation clearly visible, emphasizing interior transparency and a distinct separation from the more opaque, gridded upper massing. This explicit contrast in façade articulation and vertical hierarchy is essential.
