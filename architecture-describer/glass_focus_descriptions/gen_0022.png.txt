A rectilinear glass building with a stepped massing, showing two visible floors, the ground floor clearly taller—approximately double the height of the upper floor. The façade is defined by a strict glass curtain wall system: primary elevation subdivided into 6 horizontal bays across the main faces, with each bay vertically subdivided by slender black mullions approximately 6cm thick. Upper floor glazing exhibits a strong vertical and horizontal grid, each floor distinctly articulated with horizontal breaks at floor slabs, but no opaque spandrels—only transparent or lightly tinted glass. The ground floor is volumetrically and visually distinct: continuous floor-to-ceiling glass panels run horizontally, completely uninterrupted by vertical mullions or divisions, creating a seamless transparent façade. Warm interior lighting and open interiors are clearly visible at the base, contrasting sharply with the denser mullion grid above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; this distinct visual transition and uninterrupted transparent glazing at base must be unequivocal.
