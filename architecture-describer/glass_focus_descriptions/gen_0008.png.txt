A cube-like building with five visible floors, each defined by a strict façade grid of vertically and horizontally aligned metal panels, with the upper four floors featuring approximately four horizontal bays per face and each bay subdivided vertically by slim mullions (~6 cm thick); upper floors have distinct ribbon windows with no spandrels but a regular rhythm of narrow panels separating glazed sections. The massing is sculpted with multiple horizontal setbacks at each floor, creating a staggered appearance; upper floors appear of uniform height while the ground floor is explicitly taller—nearly double in proportion. The ground floor features uninterrupted transparent glazing with absolutely NO vertical mullions or divisions, creating a smooth volumetric base completely distinct from the upper façade grid; warm interior lighting and high transparency make interior spaces clearly visible, further emphasizing a stark visual and architectural transition. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, making the base’s volumetric distinction and transparency unmistakable compared to the regular, mullioned upper modules.
