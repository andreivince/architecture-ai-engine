A cubic glass building with four visible floors: the ground floor is double-height, approximately twice as tall as each upper floor, which are of equal height. The façade is defined by a strict rectilinear grid of vertical mullions (~8 cm thick) and horizontal spandrels, creating a pronounced rhythmic module. There are 8 horizontal bays across each elevation, and each floor above the base is subdivided into 3 vertical sections per bay by continuous mullions, with spandrels marking each floor break, but the ground floor glazing is distinctly different—featuring uninterrupted transparent glass wrapping the base with NO vertical mullions or divisions, forming a clear volumetric and visual transition. Warm interior lighting is visible at the ground floor, and interior spaces are clearly seen through the smooth, mullion-free glass. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; emphasize the contrast between the base and the upper grid system.
