A rectilinear contemporary building with 8 visible floors, the ground floor distinctly taller (approximately double the upper floor height), features a dramatic base with uninterrupted transparent glazing and NO vertical mullions or divisions, creating smooth continuous glass panels and a pronounced volumetric distinction from above; warm interior lighting and clear visibility into the ground floor emphasize this separation. The upper 7 floors are arranged in a staggered, modular massing with visible cantilevered modules forming terraces, each floor subdivided into a variable rhythm of 3–5 horizontal bays, with each bay defined by aluminum or steel mullions roughly 7–10 cm thick, marking regular vertical and horizontal grid lines. Spandrels are absent; there are no floor breaks between upper levels, and the façade is clad in light metallic panels set between large glazed sections, producing a rigid, gridded rhythm. The upper floors exhibit clear vertical mullions and bays, contrasting sharply with the ground floor’s uninterrupted, mullion-free transparent glazing. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, establishing an explicit visual transition between base and tower.
