A rectilinear building with four visible floors, each floor above the base appearing of equal height except for a clearly taller ground floor (approximately double the height of the upper floors), features a strict vertical façade grid with consistently spaced mullions roughly 15-20 cm thick and horizontal spandrels marking the floor breaks between all upper stories. The façade is subdivided into nine horizontal bays and each bay is further divided vertically by the repeat of mullions, creating a rigid, repetitive rhythm. The upper three floors utilize continuous vertical mullions and spandrels between every level, emphasizing a gridded glazing module, while the ground floor is explicitly different: the ground floor massing is taller, with uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping the base, no vertical mullions or divisions in the glass, smooth floor-to-ceiling panels, strong volumetric distinction, warm interior lighting, and clear visibility through to the inside. The contrast is stark—upper floors present a strict modular grid with visible mullions and spandrels, but the base is defined by a seamless glass envelope with NO vertical mullions, a distinct visual transition. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
