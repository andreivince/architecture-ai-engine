A rectilinear modern building with 6 visible floors, where the ground floor is clearly taller—approximately double the height of upper floors—featuring uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions, producing a volumetric distinction; warm interior lighting enhances interior visibility through the smooth ground floor glass, sharply contrasting with a strict grid façade above. The upper five floors exhibit a rigid curtain wall system subdivided into 5 horizontal bays per elevation and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, separated by thin mullions approx. 6 cm wide; opaque spandrels demarcate each floor slab, creating a pronounced horizontal floor break rhythm. In plan, the massing includes cantilevered box modules at multiple levels, introducing staggered balcony recesses that break the regularity of the façade grid. No ground floor spandrel is present. State clearly: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; the transition at the base is distinct and unmistakable.
