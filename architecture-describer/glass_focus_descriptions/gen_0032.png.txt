A rectilinear building with 2 visible floors, the upper level matching the lower in overall footprint, utilizing a strict vertical façade grid; upper floors defined by a uniform pattern of 8 horizontal bays with each bay subdivided into approximately 5 vertical modules per bay, each delineated by mullions estimated at 6-8 cm in thickness, producing a dense rhythm of slender, equally spaced vertical and horizontal elements with no visible spandrels or floor breaks. The ground floor is clearly distinct: it is visibly taller than the upper floor, approximately double-height, and features uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor panels, creating a volumetric and material transition. Warm lighting and interior elements are directly visible through the base, emphasizing a strong contrast to the repetitive, closely spaced upper grid of mullions. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; there is a distinct visual transition between the base’s uninterrupted transparent glazing and the regimented, subdivided façade of the upper story.
