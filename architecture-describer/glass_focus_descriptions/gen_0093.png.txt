A cubic modernist building with three visible floors, the ground floor is distinctly taller than the upper levels, estimated at nearly double their height; the façade consists of a precise rectilinear glass grid with 7 horizontal bays per visible façade and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, each subdivision framed by vertical mullions approximately 10 cm thick; spandrels are nearly absent, creating unbroken vertical glazing except where horizontal floor lines are subtly suggested; the upper floors exhibit a strict rhythm of dark, evenly spaced mullions and full-height transparent glazing, while the ground floor is visually and volumetrically differentiated by uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, resulting in a smooth, continuous glass façade with clear, warm interior lighting and strong interior visibility, establishing a distinct visual transition and base grid contrast; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
