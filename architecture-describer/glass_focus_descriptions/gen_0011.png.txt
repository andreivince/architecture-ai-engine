Rectilinear building with a three-storey façade, all sides visible, featuring a strict regular grid; the ground floor is distinctly taller than upper levels (ground floor approximately double the height of upper floors), presenting uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—there is a clear volumetric and material transition, as upper floors display a tight rhythm of vertical mullions (approx. 12–15 cm thick) and horizontal divisions, forming vertical subdivisions every 1.5–2 meters and a visible spandrel at each slab; there are 13 horizontal bays per major façade, with every floor above the base subdivided by mullions and horizontal spandrels, while the ground floor shows continuous glass panels with maximum interior visibility, strong warm lighting, and a seamless visual permeability; the strict upper façade grid (mullioned and layered) contrasts with the base’s open, mullion-free volume; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—a distinct visual transition between base and upper module, all levels exhibiting precise rectilinear massing.
