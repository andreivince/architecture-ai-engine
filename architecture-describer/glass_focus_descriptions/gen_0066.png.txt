A six-story commercial building with a rectilinear massing and curtain wall façade, featuring a strict modular grid. The ground floor is double-height—substantially taller than the five upper floors—with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, producing a distinct visual transition and clear volumetric distinction from upper levels; warm lighting and interior spaces are visible at base. Above are five uniform floors with each floor subdivided into seven horizontal bays and three vertical modules per bay, separated by slender vertical mullions approximately 5 cm thick, and narrow spandrels marking breaks between floors; there are no significant overhangs or setbacks except for occasional slight recesses creating minimal articulation. Each upper level’s façade strictly repeats the vertical and horizontal rhythm of the grid pattern, with visible opaque spandrels between floors, but the ground floor is completely different, with continuous glass lacking mullions, emphasizing openness and transparency. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—this base/grid/massing hierarchy and contrast is absolutely essential.
