High-rise building with a total of 17 visible floors; the ground floor is double-height and approximately twice the height of upper floors, distinctly separated with a volumetric setback and fully glazed using uninterrupted transparent glass—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, providing complete visual transparency and showcasing warm interior lighting; clear visual transition at the base. Upper façade organized into a strict modular grid: each floor contains 5 horizontal bays and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay, defined by dark mullions approximately 10–12 cm thick, forming a strong vertical and horizontal rhythm. No horizontal spandrels or visible floor breaks between upper levels—continuous glass and mullion arrangement dominates, and the projecting volumes at bay ends accentuate the building’s orthogonal massing; upper floors are uniform in height and transparency, all different from the distinct, smooth, mullion-free glass of the ground floor. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; the separation between base and tower grid is pronounced and explicit.
