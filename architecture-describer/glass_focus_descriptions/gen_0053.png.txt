A rectilinear glass building, three visible floors in total, with the ground floor markedly taller than the upper levels, approximately twice their height. The façade is composed of a rigid grid defined by slender vertical mullions, each about 8-10 cm thick, dividing each elevation into 8 horizontal bays; each floor above the base contains 3 vertical subdivisions per bay, with black metal spandrels marking each floor break. The rhythm of the upper massing is uninterrupted and highly regular, but the ground floor is entirely distinct: it features a continuous expanse of transparent glazing wrapping the base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating uninterrupted glass panels. Interior warm lighting and clear visibility are present at the base, with a noticeable volumetric and material distinction from the upper grid. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, producing a distinct visual transition between the base and the upper façades; emphasize the strong grid and floor breaks above, but a transparent, open, and inviting base.
