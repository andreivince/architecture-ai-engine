A rectilinear office building with four visible floors, the fa√ßade is entirely glazed and organized into a precise structural grid, with each floor (except the ground) comprising six horizontal bays and four vertical subdivisions per bay; mullions are approximately 10 cm thick and extend vertically with metallic finish, clearly separating each glazing module, while spandrels or horizontal floor breaks are minimally expressed. The ground floor is distinctly taller than upper floors, at an estimated double-height, and features uninterrupted transparent glazing, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on this base level, producing a smooth, continuous glass surface that maximizes interior visibility; warm interior lighting is visible, and the volumetric distinction of the base is strongly emphasized. Directly above, the upper three floors are of regular, lesser height, each subdivided by a rigid orthogonal grid of visible vertical mullions, sharply contrasting with the seamlessness of the ground floor. There is a clear visual transition at the base: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
