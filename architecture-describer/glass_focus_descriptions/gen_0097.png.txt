A cubic glass building with five visible floors, with the ground floor distinctly taller—approximately 1.5 times the height of upper stories—featuring uninterrupted transparent glazing without vertical mullions or divisions; the base uses clear glass panels for maximum visibility, with interior warm lighting and a pronounced volumetric distinction from the upper grid, making the ground floor space clearly more open and inviting. The building façade above ground floor is characterized by a rigid curtain wall system with visible vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick, creating a strong modular rhythm of six horizontal bays per façade side and five vertical subdivisions per floor, with clear horizontal spandrels between floors. The upper floors use consistent metal and glass modules, while recessed balconies on multiple levels introduce negative space and break the massing. Explicitly, the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; there is a distinct visual transition from the uninterrupted transparent glazing at base to the regularized gridded module above, with no visual vertical mullions at the ground level but clear mullion divisions on all upper floors.
