A rectilinear building with 8 visible floors, where the ground floor is distinctly taller than upper floors, approximately twice the standard floor height, forming a volumetric and visual base with uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing; warm lighting and clear interior visibility reinforce ground floor distinctiveness. The upper seven floors follow a strict horizontal and vertical grid of modular panels: approximately 4 horizontal bays per face per floor with variable depth, and each bay subdivided vertically into two or three sections; visible dark mullions (estimated 10 cm thick) outline glazing and panel joints, establishing a regular rhythm. Spandrels are present as opaque horizontal bands between floors, creating strong floor breaks. Upper levels feature projecting modules and offset massing, but grid pattern is consistent across all upper floors; no upper floor is materially or transparently differentiated from its neighbors. The façade exhibits a clear visual transition between the ground floor and standard grid above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—explicitly contrasting the transparent, open base with the segmented, rectilinear massing and grid above.
