A rectilinear building with visible massing articulated in three offset box-like volumes, each with a distinct but seamless façade treatment, the structure clearly expresses three above-ground floors; the ground floor is approximately double-height relative to upper floors, accentuated by larger, continuous glass panels wrapping the base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, resulting in a smooth, uninterrupted transparent façade at the base with full interior visibility and volumetric distinction, the upper floors are organized into a precise grid defined by narrow vertical aluminum mullions approximately 10 cm thick and fine horizontal divisions with no visible spandrels, each floor subdivided into 8-9 horizontal bays per façade module and 3-4 vertical subdivisions per bay, with the ground floor punctuated by warm interior lighting and a strong visual transition between base and grid—state clearly: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and the upper floors feature a uniform, rhythmic grid of glazing segmented by closely spaced vertical mullions, producing a strict architectural contrast between the ground floor’s open transparency and the upper façade’s tight repetitive pattern.
