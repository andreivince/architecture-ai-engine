Rectilinear glass-walled building with four visible floors; ground floor is explicitly double-height, measuring approximately twice the height of upper levels, and features uninterrupted transparent glazing at base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, establishing a distinct visual transition from the upper grid pattern; warm lighting with clear views into the interior, emphasizing volumetric distinction at base; upper three floors each present regular height, divided façade rhythm into eight horizontal bays and five vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, each bay separated by slender mullions estimated at 6–8 cm in thickness, and no visible spandrels or horizontal floor breaks—only the strict rectilinear mullion grid; the massing is cubic, curtain wall, upper floors glazed with metallic vertical and horizontal framing, creating precise module repetition; THE GROUND FLOOR MUST APPEAR TALLER, WITH SMOOTH, MULLION-FREE GLASS DIFFERENT FROM THE UPPER GRID PATTERN; ensure contrast between transparent, open, double-height ground floor base and tightly controlled upper level façade grid—treat base, grid, and massing as distinctly separate architectural zones.
