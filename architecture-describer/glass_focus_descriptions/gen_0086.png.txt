A rectilinear building with 8 visible floors uses a stacked modular massing, featuring significant horizontal offsets and cantilevers on upper levels; the ground floor is distinctly taller than all others (approximately double height), forming a visually prominent base. Its façade comprises large, uninterrupted transparent glazing, with absolutely NO vertical mullions or divisions, creating a smooth, mullion-free glass surface at the base—ground floor interior is visible and warmly lit, emphasizing volumetric distinction and openness. Above the base, the upper 7 floors display a strict, regular curtain wall grid: each floor is subdivided into a rhythm of 6 horizontal bays, with clear vertical and horizontal mullions about 10 cm thick, forming a repetitive module; spandrels are minimally expressed, with a dominant glazed appearance and occasional recessed balcony openings disrupting the grid on multiple levels. Several modules are recessed, generating voids and horizontal breaks, especially on the upper half. The façade transitions sharply at the ground level—explicit: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating a distinct visual transition between the uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and the heavily articulated, gridded upper stories.
