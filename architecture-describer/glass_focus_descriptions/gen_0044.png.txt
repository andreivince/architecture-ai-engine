A rectilinear glass building with five visible floors; massing is a pure box volume with a regular modular grid façade. The upper four floors are subdivided into a strict grid of six horizontal bays across each main elevation and five vertical subdivisions per floor, separated by metal mullions approximately 6 cm thick; the grid is further articulated by horizontal spandrel bands at each floor, creating clear floor breaks. The vertical rhythm of the upper façade is consistent, with every bay delineated using these continuous mullions, giving a regular façade pattern. The ground floor is distinctly different: it is double-height, measuring at least twice the height of the typical upper floors, and features uninterrupted transparent glazing across all street-facing sides with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, resulting in a completely smooth glass envelope at the base. Warm interior lighting is clearly visible at the ground floor, highlighting volumetric distinction and providing increased interior visibility compared to the more reflective upper floors. There is a sharp, explicit, and visually distinct transition between this seamless, taller ground floor façade and the gridded upper storeys. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
