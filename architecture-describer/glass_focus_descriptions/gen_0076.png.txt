A rectilinear building of six visible floors, featuring a façade of vertically-oriented glass modules arranged in a strict grid, with 8 horizontal bays across and 7 vertical subdivisions per typical floor, separated by slender vertical mullions approximately 7 cm thick; no visible horizontal spandrels or floor breaks disrupt the grid's rhythm except where massing steps back, and the fenestration pattern is consistent on all upper floors, with no floor clearly differentiated by material, height, or transparency. The ground floor is visually and volumetrically distinct, approximately double the height of any upper floor, enclosed by uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—emphasizing continuous glass panels at the base, warm interior lighting, and high interior visibility, in stark contrast to the upper grid pattern. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating a distinct visual transition and a clear break in the façade’s architectural rhythm between the base and the floors above.
