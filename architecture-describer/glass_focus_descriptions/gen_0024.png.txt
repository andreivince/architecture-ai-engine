A rectilinear glass office building with four visible floors, where the ground floor is clearly taller than the upper levels, approximately double their height and visually distinct; the façade is organized into a rhythmic grid of seven horizontal bays and four vertical subdivisions per main section on each upper floor, separated by thin vertical mullions approximately 7cm thick and regular horizontal floor breaks, with no visible spandrels between the levels. The massing steps back on the top floor in a modular fashion, creating a staggered volumetric profile. The upper floors display transparent curtain wall glazing divided by regular mullions and floor breaks, forming a strict orthogonal architectural grid. In strong contrast, the ground floor uses uninterrupted transparent glazing, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—the glass panels at the base are large, smooth, and continuous, revealing warm interior lighting and visible activity inside, creating volumetric distinction and a clear visual transition from the upper grid; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
