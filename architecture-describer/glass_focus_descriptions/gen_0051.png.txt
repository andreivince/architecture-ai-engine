A rectangular modernist building with five visible floors, the ground floor is double-height and visually distinct from the upper levels; it features uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, creating a seamless glass façade at the base with warm interior lighting and high interior visibility, standing out volumetrically and in transparency from the rest. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. Above, four regular floors are structured in a highly regular façade grid: each elevation shows 7 horizontal bays and 4 vertical subdivisions per floor, delineated by prominent vertical mullions (~7-10 cm wide) and thinner horizontal spandrels. Spandrels are visible and clearly separate each floor, establishing a strict horizontal rhythm. The massing is rectilinear, with crisp corners and a flat roof. The explicit contrast: the ground floor’s tall, uninterrupted transparent glazing at base forms a distinct visual transition to the rigidly gridded, subdivided upper façades with regular mullions, spandrels, and clear module repetition.
