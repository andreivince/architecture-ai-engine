A rectilinear glass tower with a total of 12 visible floors, where the ground floor is clearly double-height—approximately twice the height of the upper floors—creating a strong volumetric base. The façade is defined by a regular grid of vertical and horizontal mullions on all upper floors, with each elevation divided into four horizontal bays and twelve vertical subdivisions per floor; mullions are approximately 8 cm thick. Each upper floor features rhythmic projecting balconies at both corners, introducing pronounced vertical and horizontal articulation, but with continuous glazing and visible grid lines between the floors—no spandrels interrupt the grid. The ground floor is distinctly set apart with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, showing NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, warm interior lighting, and clear visual access inside, marking a sharp transition from the rigid upper grid pattern. The massing emphasizes a strong podium effect; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and a distinct visual transition between the base and upper façade.
