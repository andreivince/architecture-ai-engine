A rectilinear modern building with three visibly stepped volumes, the façade clad entirely in glass curtain wall modules structured by vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick; upper floors are arranged in a strict, repetitive vertical rhythm, subdivided into 8 bays per principal elevation, with each floor delineated by horizontal spandrels subtly expressed between floors, and each volume containing 2 visible floors above the base. The ground floor is distinctly double-height—substantially taller than upper floors—and features uninterrupted transparent glazing with absolutely NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor panels, providing a clear volumetric and visual transition at the base. The ground floor exhibits smooth, floor-to-ceiling glass panels, warm lighting, and clear interior visibility, sharply contrasting with the tight vertical grid pattern above. The massing steps back with each volume, generating dynamic volumetric offsets without altering the rigorous upper grid. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; this distinction between the uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and the articulated upper façade grid is essential.
