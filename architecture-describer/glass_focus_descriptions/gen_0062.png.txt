A rectilinear glass tower with 11 visible floors, the upper floors feature a rigid façade grid made of dark metal mullions approximately 7-10 cm thick, forming a regular curtain wall system with 5 horizontal bays and 7 vertical subdivisions per elevation per floor, with no spandrels or floor breaks between stories; mullions continue uninterrupted vertically and horizontally across all upper floors, creating a strict and uniform rhythm. The ground floor is distinctly taller, approximately double the height of the upper floors, and visually set apart with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, yielding a smooth, continuous glass façade at the base. Warm interior lighting and high interior visibility are clearly present at the ground level, which is volumetrically distinct beneath the elevated massing supported by stout concrete plinths. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—explicitly emphasize the distinct visual transition between the seamless, double-height transparent base and the rigid, gridded mullioned upper façade.
