A square-plan building with five visible floors, each articulated by a strict rectilinear façade grid; massing is defined by horizontal bands that cantilever irregularly per floor, creating pronounced volumetric offsets. The ground floor is clearly taller than the upper floors—appearing nearly double-height—with smooth, uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base: NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, resulting in complete visibility into the interior and a distinct visual transition. Warm interior lighting is visible at the ground floor, enhancing volumetric distinction. The upper four floors exhibit a regular grid of vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick, with horizontal spandrels marking each floor break; for each façade, there are 6 horizontal bays and 2 vertical subdivisions per floor, generating a consistent rhythm. On upper levels, vertical mullions and spandrels frame all glazing panels, but the ground floor is entirely mullion-free, emphasizing the base’s transparency and separation from the articulated grid above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; this contrast in façade treatment is essential for accurate massing and hierarchy.
