A rectilinear building with three visible floors, the façade composed of a strict vertical and horizontal grid formed by metal mullions approximately 8-10 cm thick, organizing the surface into modules roughly 1.2 meters wide; each floor is subdivided into eight horizontal bays, with each bay showing three to four vertical subdivisions per floor. The ground floor is distinctly recessed and must be described separately: it is a single-height base (not double-height), but it stands out through the use of uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—creating a smooth, clear volumetric distinction from the gridded upper levels. Upper floors have strong, uniform vertical mullions with no spandrels, maintaining a continuous grid rhythm, while the ground floor’s uninterrupted glass provides a clear visual break and transition, emphasizing transparency and open visibility into the volume. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; the model must make this base/upper contrast explicit, with the transparent, seamless glazing and volumetric offset at the base forming a distinct visual transition from the regular, subdivided façade above.
