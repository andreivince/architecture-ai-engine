A rectilinear mid-rise building with 6 visible floors; the ground floor is double-height, distinctly taller than all upper levels—approximately twice their height—with a dramatic volumetric contrast. The façade is fully glazed with a pronounced, regular grid of slender vertical mullions, each approximately 6 cm thick, and thinner horizontal transoms delineating each floor on upper levels. The upper 5 floors display a strict modular rhythm of 9 vertical bays horizontally, divided by mullions, and each floor has 2 vertical subdivisions per bay, producing a fine lattice over lightly reflective glazing. Spandrels at floor breaks are minimized, with emphasis on continuous glass. The ground floor stands apart: it features uninterrupted transparent glazing, absolutely NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, allowing open views into a brightly lit interior space. Several bays show interior warmth and visibility, highlighting volumetric and transparency distinction at the base. Explicitly: The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, ensuring a clear visual break between the base and uniformly subdivided upper façade.
