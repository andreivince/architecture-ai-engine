A rectilinear glass-and-steel building with six visible floors; the ground floor is double-height and clearly taller than the five upper floors, which are all of equal and shorter height. The façade is organized in a strict grid: each face is subdivided into 5 horizontal bays and 7 vertical subdivisions per floor above the base, with black vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick, creating a pronounced rhythm. Horizontal spandrels are minimal; only thin floor breaks are perceptible between levels. All upper floors use clear glazed modules within the mullion grid, while the ground floor is distinctly different—featuring uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions at the base, creating a volumetric and visual transition. The ground floor must appear significantly taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass distinct from the upper grid pattern, revealing warmly lit interiors with visible furnishings and a heightened sense of openness. The explicit contrast between the base and the upper floors is essential: uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, gridded and mullioned rhythm above, ground floor MUST be taller and visually distinct.
