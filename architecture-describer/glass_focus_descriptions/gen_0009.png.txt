A rectilinear office building with five visible floors, each floor above the ground using a strict vertical grid system; façade consists of a modular curtain wall of glass and metal, with 8 horizontal bays across the main face and 4 vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, yielding glazing modules separated by thin vertical and horizontal mullions (approximately 7 cm thick); upper floors are uniform in height, with no distinct floor breaks or spandrel panels visible between floors and consistent transparency throughout, except the clearly differentiated ground floor, which is approximately double the height of upper stories and composed entirely of large, uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—creating a distinct visual transition and volumetric distinction at the base; ground floor façade reveals interior with warm lighting and higher volumetric space, clearly contrasting with the rigid upper grid; the massing steps back at upper levels, maintaining orthogonal lines and regular rhythm above; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, emphasizing the base’s uninterrupted transparency and explicit separation from the repetitive, subdivided upper façade modules.
