A rectilinear glass building with three visible floors; ground floor is double-height and distinctly taller than the upper two, measuring approximately 1.8 times the height of the typical upper floors. Façade is organized into a strict vertical grid with nine vertical bays per major face and clear vertical subdivisions with aluminum mullions approximately 8–10 cm thick. All upper floors above the base feature a repetitive rhythm of vertical mullions and horizontal divisions, creating a modular grid pattern; no noticeable spandrels, only glass panels divided by thin frames. Building massing consists of intersecting rectangular prisms, with corners articulated by uninterrupted vertical mullions, lacking significant horizontal breaks. The ground floor glazing is fully transparent, uninterrupted, and smooth, with NO vertical mullions or divisions—presenting large, clear panels that contrast sharply with the upper floor grid. Warm interior lighting and clear volumetric separation are visible at the base, coupling high transparency with interior articulation. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, forming a distinct visual transition between uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base and the rigid, mullion-dominated upper façades.
