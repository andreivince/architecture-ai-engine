A rectilinear building with three visible above-ground floors, each stepping back to create a clear volumetric massing, with the central volume extending higher than the flanking wings; the façade is a strict glass curtain wall system, using slender vertical mullions approximately 6-8 cm wide, with each floor subdivided into 10–12 vertical bays, and continuous horizontal spandrels at each floor break accentuating the rhythm. On the upper floors, each floor is of equal height except the ground floor, which is visibly taller and forms a strong visual base. The ground floor façade is fully glazed with large, uninterrupted transparent glazing panels—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—creating an open, distinctly different base from the upper floors, with clear warm interior lighting and high visibility through the glass. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and there is a distinct visual transition between the base and the uniform, slender-mullion grid of the upper façade.
