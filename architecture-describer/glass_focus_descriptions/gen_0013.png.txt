A rectilinear glass building with five visible floors, each defined by a strict modular grid; upper floors feature a rigid façade rhythm of tall, narrow vertical glazing modules, approximately 2.5 meters wide, separated by black vertical mullions roughly 6 cm thick, with no visible spandrels or prominent floor breaks, creating uninterrupted verticality. The building massing steps outward with clean, sharp volumetric articulation at the corners and edges. Each standard upper floor is of equal height, while the ground floor is distinctly taller—nearly double the height of the upper levels—and features continuous, mullion-free transparent glazing wrapping the entire base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing. Ground floor must project a clear volumetric and material distinction with warm interior lighting, unobstructed sightlines, and high transparency, contrasting starkly against the repetitive vertical grid of the upper façade. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, different from the upper grid pattern—a distinct visual transition the model must enforce.
