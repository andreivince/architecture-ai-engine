A rectilinear pavilion structure with three visible floors; the ground floor is clearly double-height and significantly taller than the two uniform floors above, resulting in a dramatic volumetric distinction. The façade is organized with a strict grid of slender vertical mullions approximately 7–10 cm thick and evenly spaced horizontal transoms, forming 7 visible horizontal bays across the main elevation and three vertical subdivisions per floor. The upper two floors feature a regular curtain wall system with clearly expressed vertical mullions and spandrel panels that delineate each story; the mullions and transoms define a precise modular rhythm, with each module nearly square. In clear contrast, the ground floor façade presents uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—this is smooth, planar, and provides maximum interior visibility with warm interior lighting visible through the base, establishing a distinct visual transition. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—this volumetric and tectonic break between base and upper stories is critical; the model must render the base with uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and clearly differentiate it from the upper facades with their regular grid and prominent vertical mullions.
