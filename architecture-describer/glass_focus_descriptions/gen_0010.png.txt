A rectilinear glass building with 3 visible above-ground floors and rooftop volume projections rises from a flat plaza; upper massing consists of a grid façade with a strict rhythm of 6 horizontal bays and 3 vertical subdivisions per major block, each delineated by thin vertical and horizontal mullions approximately 7 cm in thickness, with no visible spandrels or floor breaks, producing continuous floor-to-ceiling glazing across each floor, except where interrupted by slim module frames; the upper floors maintain identical materiality and transparency with no differentiation in height or fenestration pattern. The ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately double the height of upper floors—and is set apart by uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, forming a continuous, smooth glass façade which contrasts sharply with the upper grid, emphasizing a clear visual and volumetric break; ground floor glass offers enhanced interior visibility and subtle warm lighting. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. This unambiguous distinction between base and upper levels is critical: uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, strict mullion grid above, explicit visual transition.
