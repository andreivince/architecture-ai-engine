Rectangular glass building with 5 visible floors, each above the ground floor of equal height except for the ground floor, which is distinctly taller—approximately double the floor-to-floor height of the upper levels; façade features a strict regular grid defined by thin vertical mullions approximately 5–7 cm wide and spaced evenly to produce 9 vertical bays across the main face, with each floor subdivided into roughly 5 horizontal sections by thin horizontal muntins (no visible spandrels or opaque floor breaks); upper floors use a consistent rhythm of vertical and horizontal framing, forming a lightweight glazed grid; the ground floor is entirely different, articulated by tall, uninterrupted transparent glazing panels with NO vertical mullions or divisions, creating a volumetrically distinct base with completely smooth, continuous glass, high visibility into warmly lit interior spaces, and a sharp visual transition where the upper mullion grid abruptly starts above; the massing of the overall structure is rectilinear, with the ground floor set inward at some recesses, further emphasizing the floating superstructure. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; clearly contrast the base’s uninterrupted transparent glazing with the articulated vertical mullions and subdivisions above, ensuring a distinct visual transition between the two zones.
