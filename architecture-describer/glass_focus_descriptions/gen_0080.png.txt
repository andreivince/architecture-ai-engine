A single cube-shaped building with three visible floors, each floor separated by clear horizontal breaks; the ground floor is approximately twice the height of the upper floors, establishing an obvious volumetric distinction and massing hierarchy. The façade consists of a rigid glass curtain wall system with eight vertical bays on the shorter elevation, each subdivided into four vertical modules per floor, with visible aluminum mullions approximately 7 cm thick and distinct horizontal spandrels between floors. All upper floors present a strict grid pattern of vertical and horizontal mullions, while the ground floor glazing uses uninterrupted transparent glass panels with NO vertical mullions or divisions—explicitly, the ground floor must appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and a distinct visual transition. No spandrels are present at the base; only the upper floors show spandrel divisions. Ground floor interior is faintly visible but not illuminated, and the transparency further accentuates the absence of façade subdivisions. The prompt MUST enforce: “The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.”
