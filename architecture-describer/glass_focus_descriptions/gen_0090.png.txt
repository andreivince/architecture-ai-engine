A rectilinear building with five visible floors, each floor set back and shifted slightly in plan to create irregular massing and volumetric articulation. The façade is a pure curtain wall system, composed of translucent glass modules in a rigorous grid: approximately 7 vertical bays and 6 horizontal subdivisions per primary façade, with each module demarcated by thin metal mullions roughly 5 cm thick. Upper floors display a strict rhythm of vertical and horizontal mullions, creating a rectilinear lattice with no visible spandrels or pronounced floor breaks, only continuous grid patterns. The ground floor is differentiated from all upper levels: it is standard in height (not double-height), but features larger, uninterrupted glass panels with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, producing uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and a distinct visual transition in the envelope. Warm lighting and interior visibility are present at the base, further distinguishing it from the frosted translucency and tightly-gridded modules above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; this contrast and the base’s volumetric distinction must be explicit and unmistakable in the architectural rendering.
