A modern cubic building with four visible floors, each floor clearly delineated by horizontal bands, with the ground floor significantly taller—appearing nearly double the height of the upper levels. The façade employs a strict grid of vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick and horizontal spandrels at each floor break on upper levels. Each floor above the ground is subdivided into 7 horizontal bays and 3 vertical divisions per bay, generating a uniform rhythm of glazing panels. The upper floors exhibit continuous repetition of thin mullions and pronounced spandrels between each level, while the ground floor stands entirely distinct: it features uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, smooth floor-to-ceiling glass, and a noticeable volumetric distinction. Warm interior lighting permeates the base, and interior activity is clearly visible through this mullion-free, transparent façade. There is a clear, explicit contrast in materiality and rhythm between the ground level’s seamless glass enclosure and the upper floors’ regimented mullion-spandrel grid. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; this transition is visually stark and defines the massing base with architectural clarity.
