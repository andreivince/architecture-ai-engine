A rectilinear five-story office building with a curtain wall façade; the structure has a clearly-defined rhythmic vertical and horizontal grid of glazing modules on all upper floors, organized into six horizontal bays across and four vertical rows of modules per floor, with each bay subdivided by aluminum mullions approximately 6 cm thick and horizontal spandrels marking each floor slab. The upper floors are uniform in height, while the ground floor is visibly taller, approximately double the standard floor height, and features uninterrupted transparent glazing at its base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, providing a smooth glass surface that distinctly contrasts the strict grid pattern of the upper façade. The volumetric distinction at the base is emphasized by the large, mullion-free panels, warm interior lighting, and strong visual permeability into the lobby; the transition between the transparent base and upper grid is abrupt, with the ground floor façade visually separate and materially differentiated from the upper stories. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; upper floors have a strict grid of glass and aluminum, while only the base is transparent and uninterrupted, ensuring a distinct visual transition in both architectural rhythm and materiality.
