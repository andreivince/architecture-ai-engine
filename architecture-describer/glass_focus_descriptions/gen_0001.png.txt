A rectilinear building with five visible floors, where the ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately double the height of the upper floors—and features a smooth stone façade interrupted by large, uninterrupted transparent glazing panels at the base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing; interior is warmly lit and volumetrically recessed under an overhanging mass, with clear visual distinction from upper levels. The upper four floors present an explicit grid of vertical and horizontal mullions about 6 cm thick, dividing each face into 7 horizontal bays and 5 vertical subdivisions per floor, creating a strict modular rhythm; these floors have continuous reflective glazing with visible spandrels at each floor break. A sharp transition is evident between the base and the grid above, reinforcing hierarchy: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, which is rigidly subdivided.
