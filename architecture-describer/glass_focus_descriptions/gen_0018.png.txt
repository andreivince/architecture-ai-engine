Rectilinear, mid-rise modernist office building with six visible floors; ground floor distinctly double-height, approximately twice the height of upper floors, which are evenly stacked above. Façade articulated by a strict grid of vertical mullions (approx. 10 cm thick) and horizontal transoms, creating seven visible vertical bays and five horizontal modules per upper floor; continuous floor-to-ceiling glazing separated by pronounced mullions—NO spandrels or floor breaks between floors. Upper floors exhibit clear grid rhythm with regularly spaced vertical and horizontal divisions, all glass panels uniform in size. Ground floor explicitly different: uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, smooth surface, warm lighting emanates from interior for high visibility, creating clear volumetric and material distinction from upper grid. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; emphasize the distinct visual transition between ground floor and upper façade.
