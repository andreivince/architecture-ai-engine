A rectilinear two-story building with a glass curtain wall façade; both floors are fully visible. The ground floor is distinctly taller than the upper floor—estimated at approximately 1.5 times the height—with generous uninterrupted transparent glazing spanning horizontally, completely free of vertical mullions or divisions; this creates a smooth glass base with pronounced volumetric distinction; warm interior lighting and visible interiors emphasize its openness. In contrast, the upper floor forms a precise grid pattern: 8 horizontal bays across the main elevation, each bay subdivided by regular vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick, with each floor showing consistent vertical subdivisions; no visible spandrels or floor breaks separate the two stories. The massing at the base and upper level must explicitly contrast: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, ensuring a clear transition.
