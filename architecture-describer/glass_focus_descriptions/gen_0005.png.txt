A rectilinear glass building with a dynamic, staggered massing: six visible floors total, with the ground floor approximately twice the height of the upper floors. Façade organized in a strict vertical rhythm, each upper floor subdivided into 10 horizontal bays with 2 vertical mullions per bay, mullion thickness estimated at 5 cm, creating a precise grid pattern. All upper floors display transparent floor-to-ceiling glazing, with visible horizontal spandrels between floors accentuating the floor breaks. The ground floor is visually and volumetrically distinct: it is clearly double-height, uses uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—completely smooth glass panels wrap the base. Warm lighting illuminates the ground level, with interior spaces clearly visible, intensifying the contrast between the transparent, open base and the highly gridded, articulated upper volumes. Staggered upper portions project in plan, but the base footprint remains rectilinear. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, establishing a distinct visual transition between the open, welcoming base and the rigid modular upper façade.
