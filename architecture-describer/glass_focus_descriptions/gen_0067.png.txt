A rectangular glass building with a total of four visible floors rises from a platform surrounded by water; the upper three floors feature a rigid façade grid defined by approximately eight horizontal bays and five vertical subdivisions per visible side, each module framed by aluminum mullions of roughly 6-8 cm thickness with clear vertical and horizontal rhythm, continuous from floor to floor with no spandrels, and regular transparent glazing throughout. The ground floor is visually distinct and MUST be treated separately: it is clearly taller than the upper floors (appearing nearly double-height), with uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping around the entire base, exhibiting NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, producing a smooth, unbroken glass effect. Warm internal lighting on the base contrasts with upper floors and offers high transparency and volumetric distinction. The prompt MUST specify: “The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.” There is a pronounced visual transition between the continuous, uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and the upper rigid grid with vertical mullions; this architectural hierarchy and façade rhythm must be explicit for maximum fidelity.
