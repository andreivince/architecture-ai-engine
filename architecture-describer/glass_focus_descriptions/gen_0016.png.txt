A rectilinear modern façade with 8 visible floors, where the ground floor is explicitly taller (approximately double the height of other floors) and volumetrically distinct, features uninterrupted transparent glazing at its base: NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, producing a smooth, continuous glass surface with interior warm lighting and high transparency. The upper floors are set in a staggered massing rhythm, projecting and recessing in block-like modules, with a strict grid of 6 horizontal bays and 8 vertical subdivisions per floor, framed by dark mullions approximately 5 cm thick; spandrels are absent, as floor breaks are defined only by the regularity of glazing modules and mullions. The transition between base and tower is clear: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern above, where prominent vertical mullions and slim horizontal divisions create a rigid, articulated visual order. This distinct visual transition between seamless ground level glazing and the regimented upper façade grid is essential to the architectural intent.
