A rectilinear glass-and-steel building with three visible floors, the ground floor measuring roughly twice the height of upper levels, is shown. The façade is defined by a precise grid of slender vertical mullions, approximately 8 cm thick, and horizontal divisions establishing a clear bay structure: each elevation features 9 horizontal bays, subdivided vertically into three per floor above the base. The upper floors present a strict rhythm of glass curtainwall modules separated by continuous vertical mullions and spandrels at floor breaks, forming a consistent orthogonal lattice. The ground floor is visually and volumetrically distinguished—double-height with uninterrupted transparent glazing that wraps the base, explicitly with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glass; this base zone reveals warmly lit interiors and enhanced spatial openness, making the ground floor materially and formally distinct from the upper regularized façade. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, establishing a clear and explicit visual transition between the transparent base and the structured upper massing.
