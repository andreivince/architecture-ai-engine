A rectilinear building with a total of two visible floors, the ground floor is clearly double-height, approximately twice the height of the upper level; the façade is clad in a strict grid of floor-to-ceiling glass modules. Each main side displays eight horizontal bays per floor, with each bay subdivided vertically into three tall glass panels separated by thin black vertical mullions approximately 5 cm thick, creating a strong, uniform rhythm; there are no visible spandrels or horizontal breaks separating the floors except for a thin floor line. The ground floor is distinctly different: it features uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, allowing maximum interior visibility and revealing warm lighting inside, providing a volumetric distinction from the upper grid pattern. The transition at the base is pronounced—a distinct visual transition where the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. Upper floors maintain regular vertical mullions and strict modular regularity, whereas the base remains clear, open, and visually emphasized.
