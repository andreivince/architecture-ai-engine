A rectilinear glass office building with 7 visible floors; ground floor is double-height and clearly taller than all upper floors, displaying uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or subdivisions, creating a smooth, continuous façade, with a distinct visual transition above; the upper six floors have a rigid curtain wall grid: 6 horizontal bays and 4 vertical subdivisions per primary elevation, defined by slender aluminum mullions approximately 6 cm thick, with horizontal spandrels marking each floor break; rhythm is regular, and all upper stories feature a uniform module of transparent and translucent glazing, with no obvious material or height differentiation except at the base; the massing is box-like with sharp corners, and there is no visible ornamentation; emphatically, the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and must read as visually and volumetrically distinct from the strict, regularized upper façade.
