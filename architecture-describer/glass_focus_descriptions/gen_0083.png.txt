A cubic, modular building with 6 visible floors, where the ground floor is clearly taller—approximately double the height of the upper floors—and features uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base with NO vertical mullions or divisions, forming a distinct visual transition from the upper grid pattern; warm interior lighting is visible at the ground floor, revealing internal volumetric depth and spatial separation from the upper structure. The façade above the ground floor is entirely clad in dark, reflective glass modules divided into a regular grid by thin metal mullions approximately 5 cm thick, forming a consistent matrix of vertical and horizontal subdivisions; each upper floor consists of irregular projecting and recessed boxes with 3 to 6 horizontal bays per module and typically 2–3 vertical bays per projected section. Spandrels are not present, and there are no floor breaks—only clear glass and thin visible mullion lines. Some upper modules cantilever abruptly, creating a staggered, asymmetrical massing distinct from the flat, planar glass curtain wall of the base. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, providing a clear, strong visual separation and base-to-tower hierarchy.
