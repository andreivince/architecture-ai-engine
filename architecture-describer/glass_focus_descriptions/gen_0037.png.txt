A rectilinear modern building with four visible floors, the ground floor distinctly taller than the upper three, occupying roughly 1.8 times their height; massing articulated by a central vertical projection flanked by lower wings, all facades clad in regular curtain wall glazing. The upper floors are divided into a strict grid of 7 horizontal bays and 4 vertical subdivisions per bay, separated by slender vertical mullions approximately 7 cm thick and horizontal mullions at floor breaks; spandrel panels are absent, resulting in continuous vertical glass sections. The ground floor is a clearly differentiated double-height volume with uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glass—creating a stark volumetric and visual transition from the upper grid pattern. Warm interior lighting at base increases transparency and visibility into the interior, reinforcing the distinction in materiality and spatial rhythm from the upper stories. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; this explicit base-grid contrast and the uninterrupted transparent glazing at base are essential to the architectural composition.
