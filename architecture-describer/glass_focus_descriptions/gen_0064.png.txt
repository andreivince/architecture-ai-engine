A rectilinear glass building with five visible floors, where the ground floor is clearly double-height and notably taller than the upper levels, featuring uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—this façade base is mullion-free, displaying smooth glass panels, exhibiting warm interior lighting and high interior visibility, with a distinct volumetric setback compared to the gridded pattern above; above the base, the façade is composed of a highly regular grid of clear glazing divided into 5 horizontal bays and 4 vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, defined by slender metallic mullions approximately 7 cm thick, running vertically and horizontally, creating a strict, rectilinear rhythm, with no discernible spandrels or floor breaks and each upper floor of uniform height and transparency, except for the ground floor which MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass distinct from the orthogonal upper grid pattern; an irregular modular massing is present, protruding and recessing at upper levels, emphasizing the strong visual transition between the transparent ground floor and rational, highly articulated upper façade.
