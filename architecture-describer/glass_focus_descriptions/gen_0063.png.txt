A rectilinear building with three visible floors; the ground floor is distinctly taller than the upper stories, approximately double their height, giving the base strong volumetric distinction. The fa√ßade consists of a rigid, regular grid of vertical and horizontal black mullions on the upper two floors, each floor vertically subdivided into nine bays, with each bay further subdivided by slender 6-8 cm thick mullions, forming a tight lattice; prominent horizontal divisions mark the separation between floors, acting as spandrels. The upper floors exhibit repetitive rhythm and consistent glazing proportions, with clear vertical emphasis and transparent glass. The ground floor, by contrast, features UNINTERRUPTED transparent glazing on all sides, with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glass; warm interior lighting is highly visible, creating an inviting facade with open sightlines, and no spandrels interrupt the base transparency. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, establishing a distinct visual transition and base articulation.
