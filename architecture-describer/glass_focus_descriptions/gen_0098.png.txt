A modern glass office building with five visible floors; the ground floor is clearly taller, approximately double the height of the upper four floors, and is volumetrically distinguished by completely uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, resulting in smooth, floor-to-ceiling glass panels at the base, with warm interior lighting and clear visibility into the lobby, establishing a distinct visual transition from the rigid upper fa√ßade; above, each of the four upper floors has a consistent curtain wall grid pattern composed of six horizontal bays and regular vertical subdivisions, separated by vertical mullions approximately 8-10 cm thick and continuous horizontal spandrels between floors, forming a strict modular rhythm with no differentiation in height or material between these floors; the overall massing features staggered rectangular volumes projecting at the corners, but the fenestration and mullion grid remain uninterrupted across the main planes. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. Vertical mullions are visible on the upper floors but NOT on the ground floor, enforcing a clear base-grid hierarchy and pronounced transition at street level.
