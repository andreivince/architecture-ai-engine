A rectilinear building with six visible floors, where the ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately twice the height of any upper floor—emphasizing clear volumetric distinction. The façade employs a rigid vertical rhythm: each elevation consists of 7 uniform horizontal bays per main façade, each subdivided by vertical mullions approximately 10 cm thick, with no visible spandrels or horizontal floor breaks, producing an uninterrupted vertical grid above the base. The upper floors use consistent glazing modules, each floor subdivided vertically with identical mullion spacing, forming a strict grid pattern. The ground floor is completely different: it features uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, providing a seamless glass skin at the base, with interior spaces brightly illuminated by warm lighting and full visual access inside. The massing steps back slightly at the rooftop, detectable at the uppermost level. The transition between ground floor and upper façade is explicit, with a clear band demarcating where the base ends and the gridded façades begin. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; insist on uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and a distinct visual transition between the transparent, voluminous ground level and the repetitive, mullion-structured upper stories.
