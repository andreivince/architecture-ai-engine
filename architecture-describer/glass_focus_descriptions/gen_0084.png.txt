A cubic glass office building with 4 visible floors; ground floor is double-height, approximately twice the height of upper floors, and is recessed, creating a volumetric distinction at the base. The ground floor features uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glass—allowing warm interior lighting and clear visibility into the space, forming a distinct visual transition. Each upper floor utilizes a strict vertical grid façade with 7 horizontal bays per façade, each subdivided by consistent, slender vertical mullions approximately 6 cm thick, creating 5 vertical subdivisions per bay per floor; horizontal spandrels are present between floors, giving strong horizontal floor breaks. Upper floor modules exhibit a rhythmic pattern of alternating glazing and solid spandrels, while the ground floor modules are entirely smooth and mullion-free. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; contrast between the transparent, open base and the regimented, vertical mullion grid of the upper levels is explicit and essential.
