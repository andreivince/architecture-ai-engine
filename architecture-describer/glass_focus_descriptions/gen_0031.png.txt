Rectangular glass pavilion with two visible floors; the ground floor is distinctly taller, approximately double the height of the upper floor, establishing a strong volumetric base. The façade exhibits a strict vertical rhythm with 9 evenly spaced bays horizontally and 2 vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, separated by slender mullions approximately 7–10 cm thick. The upper floor maintains this precise bay division and includes visible vertical mullions and horizontal spandrels above and below window modules, creating a clear grid pattern. On the ground floor, the façade consists of uninterrupted transparent glazing panels with NO vertical mullions or divisions, resulting in smooth, continuous glass—this generates a distinct visual transition and a sharp contrast from the articulated upper façade grid. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. The interior is visible through the base’s glazing, and the lighting is warm, enhancing interior views. Explicitly emphasize the massing’s two floors with pronounced difference: a volumetrically emphasized, tall, uninterrupted transparent glazing at base, topped by a regular, precisely subdivided grid of glazing above, demonstrating a clear break in both rhythm and transparency between ground and upper floors.
