A rectilinear glass building with five visible floors, the ground floor clearly double-height and taller than the upper levels; façade massing is volumetrically simple with slight setbacks and facets along the edges; explicit grid organization with 13 horizontal bays and 5 vertical subdivisions per upper floor, each subdivision separated by thin vertical mullions approximately 6 cm thick; each floor above the ground has strong vertical rhythm, consistent bay width, and visible horizontal floor breaks, with horizontal spandrels between floor slabs; upper four floors are uniform in transparency and material, regular aluminum mullions and spandrels throughout; the ground floor is distinctly different: double-height, smooth uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—clear volumetric and material distinction from the upper grid pattern; warm interior lighting and full interior visibility emphasize the base; the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, establishing a distinct visual transition at the base.
