A rectilinear building with five visible floors, the façade is entirely glazed with a regular vertical and horizontal grid created by thin black mullions approximately 6 cm thick; all upper floors feature consistent window modules with seven horizontal bays and four vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, with visible spandrels marking clear floor breaks. The ground floor is single-height but visually distinguished by much taller glazing panels relative to the upper floors and features NO vertical mullions or divisions—just large, smooth, uninterrupted transparent glass panels resulting in a volumetric and visual distinction; interior space and warm lighting are visible at this level. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, and there is a distinct visual transition between the mullion-free base and the rigidly gridded upper façade. The overall massing is boxy and symmetrical, with no visible ornamentation, setbacks, or projections aside from a subtle planar shift at the corners.
