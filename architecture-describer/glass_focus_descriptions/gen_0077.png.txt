A rectilinear modern building with 5 visible floors, the ground floor clearly taller than the upper levels, exhibiting volumetric shifts and offsets in the massing both horizontally and vertically. The upper façade is strictly defined by a rhythmic grid: each floor (excluding ground) is divided into approximately 7 horizontal bays, each bay further subdivided into 2 to 3 vertical panels by prominent vertical mullions roughly 6-8 cm thick; horizontal spandrels or floor breaks are visually minimal but perceptible as subtle changes in the opaque or semi-opaque panel sections. Glazing is highly regular on upper floors, with clear glass modules alternating with opaque spandrel panels, creating a pronounced grid. The ground floor is recessed in multiple bays, double-height compared to upper floors, and distinguished by continuous, uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glass, ensuring a distinct visual transition from the upper grid—this base is notably different in both material and openness. Warm interior lighting is visible at the base with clear volumetric separation and enhanced interior visibility. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; ensure strict contrast between the uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base and the vertically divided, gridded upper façade.
