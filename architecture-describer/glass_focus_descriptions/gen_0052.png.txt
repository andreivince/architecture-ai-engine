A rectilinear building with 8 visible floors, the ground floor clearly double-height and visually distinct from upper floors, featuring uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions, smooth glass panels, and warm interior lighting—creating volumetric and visual separation; above, a grid-based façade forms a pronounced modular rhythm with 6 horizontal bays and 4 vertical subdivisions per standard floor, each defined by aluminum or steel mullions approximately 8-10 cm thick, and solid spandrels breaking each floor horizontally; several upper levels are recessed or cantilevered, producing an offset, stepped massing; only the ground floor is fully transparent and free of grid, while all upper stories exhibit a regular pattern of dark mullions and opaque spandrels; “The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.” There is a distinct visual transition between the base and the modular, gridded upper façade, with no floor-to-floor hierarchy ambiguity.
