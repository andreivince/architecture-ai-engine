A rectilinear mid-rise building with 6 visible floors, the ground floor is distinctly taller—approximately double the height of upper floors—with an absolute façade transition: at the base, use uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping the ground floor, NO vertical mullions or divisions present, fully smooth glass, high interior visibility, and a clear volumetric distinction; warm lighting is visible from within, emphasizing openness. The upper 5 floors have a strict curtain wall façade with a rhythmic grid composed of 8 horizontal bays and 5 vertical subdivisions per bay per floor, separated by thin, metallic mullions approximately 8 cm thick; vertical mullions and sharp horizontal spandrels are consistent across all upper floors, with no floor visibly different in material, height, or transparency except the base. The massing is a pure box, and the façade grid, with its repetitive modular rhythm and precise grid pattern, terminates sharply at the roof. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; emphasize this distinct visual transition between base and upper floors.
