A rectilinear modern building with five visible floors, the façade formed by a grid of ten horizontal bays and four vertical subdivisions per floor, making forty modules per elevation; black aluminum mullions, approximately 4-5 cm thick, form a strict linear rhythm both vertically and horizontally across the upper four floors. Each upper floor uses alternating transparent glazing and light-colored wood spandrels with pronounced verticality, and all upper floors are uniform in height and pattern except for balcony recesses that modulate the massing rhythmically. No obvious horizontal spandrel bands; the vertical grid dominates. The ground floor is distinctly double-height, approximately twice the height of the upper floors, and forms a volumetric base, consisting of uninterrupted transparent glazing spanning the full width of each bay with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, creating a clear distinct visual transition and full interior visibility with warm lighting. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. This explicit contrast between the transparent, mullion-free base and the orthogonally gridded upper floors with repeated mullioned modules is critical to the design’s identity.
