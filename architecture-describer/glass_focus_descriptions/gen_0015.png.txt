A modernist rectangular building with precisely two visible floors, where the ground floor is visibly taller than the upper floor—ground floor height is approximately double that of the upper—with a strong volumetric distinction at the base. The building façade is composed of a rigid glass grid: each elevation presents ten horizontal bays, each floor on the long side subdivided into ten vertical glazing modules per bay, articulated by thin aluminum mullions approximately 6 cm wide. The upper floor is characterized by a repeated rhythm of vertical mullions and horizontal floor breaks; glazing units are separated by vertical and horizontal framing, forming a strict rectilinear pattern. Spandrels are absent; floors are separated by thin horizontal lines only. The ground floor is defined by uninterrupted transparent glazing that wraps completely around the base, with NO vertical mullions or divisions—large single-plane glass panels with full visibility into a warmly lit interior, revealing greenery and interior structure, and providing a distinct visual transition from the upper grid-like structure. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern. This contrast between the uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base and the tightly gridded, evenly subdivided upper floor is critical to the architectural character and must be rendered explicitly.
