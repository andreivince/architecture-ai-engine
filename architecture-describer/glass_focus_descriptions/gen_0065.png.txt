A rectangular two-story building with a strict glass-box massing; façade comprises full-height glazing with a rigid grid of vertical mullions approximately 5–7 cm thick and horizontal spandrels at each floor slab; eleven bays horizontally and four vertical subdivisions per bay on both floors, establishing a precise rhythm; upper floor glazing is divided by these regular mullions and spandrels, making a subdivided curtain wall; the ground floor is clearly distinguished—appearing significantly taller (double-height relative to the upper floor) and featuring uninterrupted transparent glazing at base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, forming a continuous clear façade band; ground floor interior is visibly open with warm lighting and increased volumetric presence; ground and upper floors are separated by a distinct visual transition, with the ground floor’s smooth, mullion-free glass sharply differing from the upper grid pattern; building sits isolated in a flat landscape, ensuring façade details are unobstructed. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
