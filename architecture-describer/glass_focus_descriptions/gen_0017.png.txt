A rectilinear glass office building with 7 visible floors, where the ground floor is explicitly double-height (approximately twice the height of the upper floors) and clearly differentiated by uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—this base level features smooth, mullion-free glass and warm internal lighting, providing high interior visibility and strong volumetric distinction from the upper portion; above, the façade transitions abruptly to a rigid grid with 4 horizontal bays and 6 vertical subdivisions per visible elevation per floor, each module separated by thin metallic mullions approximately 8 cm thick, and horizontal spandrels are absent, creating a continuous vertical rhythm without pronounced floor breaks; all upper floors are uniform in height, material, and transparency, with no special treatments—state plainly: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, uninterrupted, mullion-free glass contrasting the regular grid and thin mullion pattern of the upper façade, enforcing a distinct visual transition at the base.
