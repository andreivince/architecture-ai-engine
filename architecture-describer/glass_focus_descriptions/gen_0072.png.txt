Rectilinear modernist building with three visible floors; the ground floor is a double-height base appearing visually taller than the upper levels, set apart by uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions—this base utilizes large, smooth floor-to-ceiling glass panels providing maximum interior visibility, distinct warm lighting, and a volumetric break from the floors above. The upper façade consists of a strict grid of evenly spaced vertical mullions (estimated 6–8 cm thick) and horizontal spandrels creating a uniform rhythm; across the main elevation, there are ten horizontal bays, each subdivided vertically into three sections per upper floor, with clear separation by mullions and spandrels creating rectangular modules of transparent and semi-reflective glazing. There are no pronounced floor breaks on upper levels, and the base-to-upper-floor transition is abrupt, establishing a distinct visual transition: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; the upper massing is blocky and modular, with no change in transparency or material between floors except for the differentiated ground floor.
