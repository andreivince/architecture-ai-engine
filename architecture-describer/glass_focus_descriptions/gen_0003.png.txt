A three-story rectilinear building with irregular box-like massing, each visible elevation features a precise curtain wall façade composed of a strict grid of glass modules defined by vertical mullions approximately 8-10 cm thick and horizontal floor breaks at each level, forming a clear repeated rhythm; each upper floor is subdivided into consistent bays of about 5-6 vertical and 3-4 horizontal panels per visible side, with no visible spandrels but floor lines subtly delineated by darker transoms. The ground floor is distinctly taller than the upper floors (approximately double in height), fully glazed in large, smooth, transparent panels with NO vertical mullions or divisions on the ground floor glazing, allowing uninterrupted views into warmly lit interiors for maximum volumetric distinction. The transition between the ground floor and upper grid pattern is stark, providing a clear visual base and grid contrast. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern—explicitly feature uninterrupted transparent glazing at base and a distinct visual transition, with no assumption of hierarchy.
