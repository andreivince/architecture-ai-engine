A cubic, tiered modern building with six clearly visible floors, each floor offset in a staggered massing to create deep horizontal parapets and recessed terraces; the façade displays a uniform, rectilinear curtain wall system dominated by vertical aluminum mullions approximately 8 cm thick and horizontal modules defining each floor, with no visible spandrels or opaque floor breaks between levels. Each floor is subdivided into 6–8 horizontal bays, with each bay further divided by regular vertical mullions. Ground floor is explicitly differentiated: it is a full double-height volume (roughly twice the height of upper floors), enclosed in uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, giving maximum visibility into warmly lit interior spaces and providing a distinct visual and volumetric transition from the upper grid pattern. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; the contrast between the base and upper volumes must be explicit, with the upper levels showing a rigid grid of mullions and the base reading as an open, transparent plinth.
