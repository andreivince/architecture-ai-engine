A rectilinear glass and steel building with four visible floors: each upper floor (floors 2-4) is of equal height, while the ground floor is distinctly taller (appears nearly double the upper floor height), creating clear volumetric distinction in the massing. The façade is articulated in a strict, regular grid: each side displays seven horizontal bays per floor, with each bay vertically subdivided into four tall, slender window modules separated by aluminum or steel mullions of approximately 6–8 cm in thickness. No spandrels are present; the floor breaks are demarcated solely by glass edge lines, resulting in uninterrupted vertical glazing rhythm across all floors above the base. The ground floor is set apart with uninterrupted transparent glazing panels that lack any vertical mullions or subdivisions, resulting in a smooth glass surface at the base; the interior is clearly visible and bathed in uniform, neutral lighting. The transition between the base and the upper floors is visually sharp, with strong contrast: the ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass, different from the regimented upper grid pattern. This explicit juxtaposition and the lack of visible spandrels or floor breaks reinforce the modernist, transparent massing.
