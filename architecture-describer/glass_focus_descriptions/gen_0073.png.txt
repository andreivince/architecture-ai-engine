A rectilinear glass building with five visible floors, each articulated by a strict facade grid of dark vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick and thinner horizontal transoms, creating six vertical bays per main facade face and typically three horizontal subdivisions per floor above the ground. The massing is a clean, box-like prism. The ground floor is distinctly double-height—taller by roughly double compared to the upper floors—and features uninterrupted transparent glazing at its base with NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, forming a continuous, smooth glass surface that allows full interior visibility, enhanced by warm lighting. There is a clear visual and volumetric distinction between the ground floor and the floors above. The upper levels show a precise regular rhythm of vertical mullions and horizontal breaks—each floor separated by narrow, consistent spandrels. All upper floors use a grid of glass modules of uniform dimension, while the ground floor has a completely different treatment: it MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating an explicit and dramatic transition at the base.
