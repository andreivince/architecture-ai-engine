A rectilinear mid-rise building with seven visible floors, each upper floor displaying a dynamic, cantilevered massing of modular rectangular volumes protruding outward in an irregular stacked arrangement; the façade uses a grid of horizontal bays, averaging five per primary elevation, with each floor subdivided vertically by slender black mullions approximately 3 cm thick; no spandrels or pronounced horizontal floor breaks are present, emphasizing vertical continuity. Upper floors exhibit a repetitive rhythm of clear and opaque panels, with transparent glazed sections alternating with solid, light-colored cladding modules in a strict grid. The ground floor is distinct and MUST be described separately: it is double-height, appearing taller than all upper levels, utilizing uninterrupted transparent glazing with NO vertical mullions or divisions, resulting in completely smooth, continuous glass panels. Warm interior lighting and maximal interior visibility are pronounced at the ground floor, establishing a clear volumetric and material transition from the upper façade’s articulated grid. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; this difference is critical—there is a distinct visual transition between the uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base and the rhythmic, mullioned upper modules.
