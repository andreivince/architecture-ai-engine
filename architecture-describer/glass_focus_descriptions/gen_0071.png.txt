Three-story rectilinear glass office building with stacking, interlocking volumes, 3 visible floors total, ground floor clearly taller (approximate ground floor height twice upper floors), each main façade face subdivided horizontally into 8–12 bays per level and vertically into 2–3 subdivisions per bay, with dark, precise vertical mullions approximately 6 cm thick on upper floors, continuous grid rhythm throughout upper stories, and NO visible spandrels or solid floor breaks; the ground floor is explicitly differentiated—taller, double-height, with FULLY uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping the base, NO vertical mullions or intermediate divisions, and strong interior visibility with noticeable warm lighting, creating a distinct visual transition between ground and upper floors; the massing uses orthogonal volumes extended and recessed, further breaking up the façade rhythm; The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
