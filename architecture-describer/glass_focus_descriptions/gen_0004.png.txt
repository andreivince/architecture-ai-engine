A rectilinear, multi-volume office building with 9 visible floors, the façade organized as a staggered grid of rectangular glass modules, each module approximately 2.5 meters wide, with horizontal and vertical rhythm strictly enforced by slim aluminum mullions around 5 cm thickness; the massing features pronounced horizontality and offset stacked boxes, creating deep terrace setbacks on various floors. The upper 8 floors utilize a grid system with prominent mullions and a regular vertical subdivision of 4 to 6 bays per face per floor, no visible spandrels, and uniform floor heights except the ground; all upper modules are flush, but some are extruded or recessed. The ground floor is distinctly different: clear volumetric separation, unmistakably taller at about twice the height of upper floors, and fully glazed with uninterrupted transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—maximizing interior visibility and featuring warm interior lighting that visually sets it apart. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, establishing a strong base and a distinct visual transition between base and tower.
