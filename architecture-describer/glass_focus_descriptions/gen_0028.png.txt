A five-story cubic building with modular massing and a strict gridded façade articulation; each visible floor forms a staggered rectilinear volume, producing dramatic cubic projections and recesses with clear planar rhythm. The exterior is clad in uniform, lightly-textured panels subdivided by recessed horizontal and vertical joints that act as mullions approximately 8 cm thick; no conventional spandrels or decorative floor breaks are present, and the overall vertical stacking is rigidly modular. The building contains five visible floors: the ground floor is roughly 1.5 times the height of the upper floors, sharply differentiated by its uninterrupted transparent glazing and NO vertical mullions or façade divisions—creating a distinct visual transition at the base. The ground floor also reveals warm interior lighting and clear volumetric distinction, establishing strong interior-exterior connectivity. Upper floors have randomly positioned rectangular window openings set within a continuous structural grid, with variable bay widths but generally two to four horizontal bays per floor and three vertical subdivisions. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, ensuring a strict architectural contrast between the transparent, open base and the opaque, highly ordered upper modules.
