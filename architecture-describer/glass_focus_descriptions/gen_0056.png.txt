A rectilinear tower with 12 clearly visible floors, the ground floor approximately double the height of upper floors, stands centrally; fa√ßade is organized into 3 bays horizontally per face and 12 vertical modules, articulated by black vertical mullions approximately 8 cm thick and horizontal floor breaks at each level, with no spandrels between floors. Each upper floor has regular vertical glazing subdivided by the mullions and interrupted by projecting balconies at the corners, giving a strong grid-like rhythm to the massing. The ground floor is distinctly different: it features uninterrupted transparent glass on all sides, NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing, providing volumetric distinction and a clear, smooth base. Warm interior lighting and high transparency make the interior highly visible at the base, creating a sharp visual transition between the uninterrupted base and the gridded, mullioned upper levels. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; emphasize this distinct visual hierarchy between the base and upper floors.
