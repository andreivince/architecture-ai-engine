A rectangular modernist building with three visible floors; the ground floor is explicitly taller than the upper two, nearly double in height, and features fully transparent uninterrupted glazing that wraps all sides, with NO vertical mullions or divisions, allowing full interior visibility and revealing warm lighting within; this creates a strong volumetric and visual distinction from the upper façade. The upper two floors are defined by a strict grid of curtain wall glazing articulated by slender metallic vertical mullions approximately 6 cm thick, and continuous horizontal spandrels at each floor break, creating a rhythm of seven horizontal bays and three vertical subdivisions per bay per floor; the grid pattern is absolutely regular, with opaque bands breaking the glazing at the floor lines. The massing above the ground floor is slightly cantilevered, reinforcing the distinct visual transition between the transparent, mullion-free ground floor glazing and the articulated, gridded upper façade. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
