A rectilinear modern tower with 11 visible floors, where the ground floor is distinctly double-height—approximately twice the height of upper levels—forms a pronounced volumetric base. The façade comprises a strict grid rhythm: each floor above the ground is divided into 5 horizontal bays per side, with each bay vertically subdivided into 4 panels per floor, framed by slender metal mullions approximately 8 cm thick. Continuous vertical mullions and clear spandrels mark each upper floor module, creating an uninterrupted gridded curtain wall. The ground floor employs floor-to-ceiling, mullion-free transparent glazing—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—setting it apart from the orthogonal upper grid; warm interior lighting and visible lobby volumes are clearly seen, emphasizing ground-level transparency and activity. The massing exhibits a crisp, right-angled profile. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, establishing a distinct visual transition and a clear base-grid hierarchy in façade expression.
