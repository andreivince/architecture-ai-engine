Rectilinear glass office building with four visible floors; ground floor clearly taller than upper floors, approximately double-height, forming a volumetric distinction at the base. Façade throughout composed of a precise grid with 7 horizontal bays on the long face and 3 bays on the short face per floor, each bay subdivided vertically by slim, dark aluminum mullions approximately 8 cm thick; regular vertical mullion rhythm and pronounced horizontal floor breaks between all upper floors, but no decorative spandrels. Crucially, the ground floor glazing wraps around the base as a continuous transparent band with NO vertical mullions or divisions—uninterrupted glass at ground floor, providing full visibility into interior. Upper floors revert to tight rectilinear grid pattern of reflective glazing, vertically and horizontally divided by exposed mullions. There is a distinct visual transition between the smooth, mullion-free ground floor and the rigid, subdivided upper façade. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern.
