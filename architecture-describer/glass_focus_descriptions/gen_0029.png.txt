A rectilinear, four-story glass building is depicted, with three upper floors of uniform height and a taller, clearly differentiated ground floor; façade is modular, with each upper floor subdivided into 7 horizontal bays and each bay divided vertically by metal mullions approximately 6–8 cm thick, creating a regular orthogonal grid pattern, further articulated by prominent horizontal spandrel panels between floors. The ground floor is double-height, with uninterrupted transparent glazing wrapping the base and NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing; inside, warm lighting and high transparency offer clear volumetric distinction from the upper grid. Across all elevations, the ground floor strongly contrasts the upper stories through both scale and glass treatment, presenting a distinct visual transition with a smooth, mullion-free surface at the base. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern; upper floors show visible vertical mullions and repetitive modules, but at the base there is uninterrupted transparent glazing for a stark hierarchical break in rhythm and materiality.
