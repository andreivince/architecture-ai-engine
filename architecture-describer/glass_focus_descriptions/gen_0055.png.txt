A rectilinear modernist building with three visible floors, each with consistent slab-to-slab heights except the ground floor, which is visibly taller and distinctly separated. The façade presents a rigorous vertical rhythm on the upper two floors, defined by closely spaced, slender vertical mullions—approximately 8 cm thick—spanning floor-to-ceiling without horizontal spandrels or floor breaks, creating an uninterrupted vertical grid; each floor is divided into 13 horizontal bays, with each bay containing three narrow vertical subdivisions. The façade glazing on upper floors is fully transparent, but visually broken by these mullions. In stark contrast, the ground floor features uninterrupted transparent glazing at the base—NO vertical mullions or divisions on ground floor glazing—resulting in a smooth, continuous glass surface that wraps the base and visually distinguishes it from the upper floors; this base-zone is volumetrically pronounced and spatially recessed relative to the box above. The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, emphasizing a distinct visual transition; if interior lighting or warm tones are present, describe their glow throughout the transparent base zone and the clear volumetric separation.
