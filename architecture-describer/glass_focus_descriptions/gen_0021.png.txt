A cube-like modern building with three visible floors: the ground floor is clearly taller—approximately double the height of the two upper floors—with a strong volumetric presence. The upper façade presents a strict rectilinear curtain wall grid: each floor is divided into 8 horizontal bays and 3 vertical subdivisions per bay, forming a precise pattern of vertical mullions (~8cm wide) and thin horizontal spandrels delineating each floor break expressly. The massing exhibits slight cantilevering modules on both upper floors, maintaining the same grid rhythm throughout. The façade glazing above the ground floor is consistently divided by visible vertical mullions and floor-to-floor spandrels, with no deviation in material or transparency, except for the proportions of certain cantilevered modules. In stark architectural contrast, the ground floor features uninterrupted transparent glazing, with NO vertical mullions or divisions—smooth glass wraps the base, distinct from the upper grid. Warm lighting from the interior is visible, enhancing this volumetric distinction. The prompt must enforce: The ground floor MUST appear taller, with smooth, mullion-free glass different from the upper grid pattern, creating a distinct visual transition between the base and the rigid, repetitively subdivided upper façade.
